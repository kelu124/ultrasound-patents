 Heretofore, the use of ultrasonic energy has been directed towards the medical and industrial markets without'any major attempt to enter the home consumer field via products incorporating an ultrasonic motor adapted'to be hand held with a complimentary converter for increasing the normal (SO-cycle per second house current to an ultrasonic range, of say 40,000 cycles per second, to energize the motor. 
 Applicants have now discovered that it is possible to produce home oriented products, by supplying to the consumer a basic kit that permits the user a major degree of flexibility in the application of ultrasonic energy to a number of areas. Accordingly, the present invention comprises one or more kits which may be variously designated as: 
I. An ultrasonic hobby kit. 
2. An ultrasonic multi-duty home service kit. 
3. An ultrasonic universal chores kit. 
4. An ultrasonic home workshop and the like. 
 spect of the ultrasonic motor technology today requires an electrical converter to increase the frequency of the normal house current to an ultrasonic rate, which rate for purposes of this invention is defined within the range of approximately 5,000 to l,000,000 cycles per second. Accordingly, the present invention in each of its various forms provides a converter, either adapted to be plugged directly into an electrical outlet through .an electrical cord or connected to a battery. The converter is electrically connected to the motor which is designed to convert the electrical energy into mechanical vibrations at an ultrasonic rate. The present invention provides various converters adapted to be used in connection with variously housed motors adaptable for a number of applications. 
a In connection with the home consumer market particularly, the cost to date of the ultrasonic motorconverter systems has hindered the introduction of ultrasonics into the consumer field in any sizeable scale. This invention provides a way for producing the ultrasonic system with the versatility necessary for practical application thereof on an economical basis.

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION Turning now to the drawings and particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2 thereof, we have disclosed an ultrasonic system or kit generally indicated by the reference numeral 10, for use by one or more users 11, seen to include a cabinet 12, on table 19, which contains therein an ultrasonic converter 15, as well as a tray or reservoir 16 forming a reservoir on the top I3 thereof, and containing a supply of liquid 18, which, in a conventional manner, is pumped from the reservoir 16 by pumping means 20 contained within the cabinet 12 and connected to the tray 16 to permit the flow of liquid 18 through the pumping means 20. Ultrasonic instrument means 22 is coupled to the converter means 15 and pumping means 20 by cable means 24 which contains a current supply line and a liquid supply line. The ultrasonic instrument 22 is comprised of accessory or implement means 25, that may have various shapes and configurations, and adapted to be removably secured to adapter or coupling means 26. The cabinet 12 contains power control means in the form of a switch 28 having an On and position and a variable switch 30 to regulate the power of converter 15. A liquid means regulator includes a switch 32 that contains a dial to vary the rate of the pump 20, which pumps the fluid from the reservoir 16 through the cable 24 in a manner which is well known in the art. 
 The cabinet 12 is seen to include support means 35 which may extend from the side wall thereof in the form of bent arms 36 to support the adapter 26 when not in use. The upper surface 13 of the cabinet 12 includes retaining means in the form of a plurality of recesses 33 adapted to receive therein in vertical relationship a plurality of accessories 25, each adapted to be interchangeable with and readily connected to the adapter 26 as hereinafter more fully described with respect to FIGS. 3-6 and FIGS. 9-18. The actual accessory 25 may consist of an ultrasonic toothbrush 38, an ultrasonic water-pick 40, or an ultrasonic prophylaxis unit 41; said water-pick, toothbrush and prophylaxis unit may be made in accordance with US. Pat. No. 3,547,l 10 issued Dec. 15, 1970, by Lewis Balamuth and entitled, Methods and Apparatus for Maintaining Tooth and Gingival Structures with Ultrasonic Energy, and which patent is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Another accessory in the form of an ultrasonic razor 42 may also be interchangeable with the adapter 26 and said razor may be of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 872,927, filed Oct. 31, I969, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,6l0,080, issued Oct. 5, I97 I by Arthur Kuris and entitled, Ultrasonic Method and Apparatus for Shaving," and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Another accessory 25 may be in the form of a container 43 adapted to receive therein a fluid which accessory may be used by the user by inserting their finger therein for doing their nails, to perform a cleansing or other operation thereon. Another accessory 44 may be in the form of a polishing head for polishing and performing other beauty care treatments. 
 The ultrasonic kit 10, as seen with respect to FIG. 1, and for which the user 11 is using an ultrasonic toothbrush in the mirror 17 on wall 14, permits each family to have their own accessory 25 available to them such that it may be readily interchangeable and connected to the adapter 26 so that when the connection is made electrical energy is transmitted to the working end of the accessory which, as indicated above, may take various shapes and forms and there is disclosed herein are only a sampling of those that might be used in accordance with the present invention. The kit illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 is seen to include an electrical plug 46 which is in a conventional manner plugged into a wall outlet and connected by cable to the generator or converter 15 that converts the normal -cycle house current to an ultrasonic rate, which as herein designed, 
is to include the frequency range of 5,000 cycles to 1,000,000 cycles per second. Obviously, the converter may be battery powered as hereinafter described, or the type in which it is battery powered, as hereinafter described, or the type in which it is battery powered for traveling but having a feature in which case a plug would still be utilized. 
 Accordingly, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a new and novel ultrasonic instrumentation that affords the user, for the first time, to have a variety of ultrasonic implements 25 available to him in a compact manner, to be useable with minimum effort by an entire family in the home. In use, the user 11 merely selects the particular accessory 25 desired for a particular need and then sets out to manually insert the accessory 25 into the adapter 26 in a simple easy manner. The power may then be energized by the On" and Off" switch 28 and the amount of liquid 18 from the reservoir 16, if any is desired, may then be selected by the variable switch 32, and the power level selected by variable control switch 30. When the user has completed the use of the accessory 25, he or she may then remove the accessory 25 from the adapter 26, replacing it in the selected retaining means 33 provided therefor and return the adapted to its support means 35. 
 FlGS. 4-6 illustrate one form of accessory 25, and adapter 26, construction that may be utilized in accordance with the embodiments of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. The accessory 25 includes an ultrasonic motor or transducer means 50 contained in a tubular housing 52 having a front end 54 and a rear end 56 with the outer wall 58 of the housing 52 having any desired contoured shape or configuration to facilitate it being handled by the user, and a tapered section 59 terminating at the front end 54 of the housing 52 with a chamber or cavity means 60 extending from the rear end 56 of the housing 52 and connected to an axial opening 62 which in turn terminates at the front end 54. 
 As seen with respect to FIG. 4, the ultrasonic'motor 50 is contained within the housing cavity 60 and the hand piece housing 52 may be of plastic or any other suitable material. 
 The ultrasonic motor 50 includes a transmission member 65 terminating at a working output end or tip 66 at one end thereof and having a rear surface or face 68 at its opposite end. The transmission member 65 may be designed in the form of an acoustical impedance transformer so that there is an increase in the amplitude of mechanical vibration from its rear face 68 to its front tip 66. The actual variations of cross sectional area to obtain the amplitude magnification is well known in the art. The transmission member 65 may be made of a metallic or plastic material depending upon its desired use, for example, if the implement as shown in FIG. 4 has a water feed associated therewith then the unit may be used for dentistry in the form of a dental prophylaxis unit by the dentist or in turn may be of a home consumer design to be used by the user in the home for maintaining tooth and gingival surfaces free of deposits normally contained on the teeth of the user. Essentially, the motor construction, as hereinafter described, for professional and home use, may be of similar design except that the relativepower for a home consumer unit would be less than that of a prefessional unit which is used by the dentist since in the home the user is in a sense doing over a 6-month period what the dentist might be doing at one sitting in the dentist's office. Accordingly, the tip 66 may be of a plastic or metallic material depending upon the use thereof and the magnitude of ultrasonic mechanical vibrations to be imparted thereto. 
The transmission member has a circular rear section 70 and front section 75, with an internally threaded bore 71 extending from its rear face 68 and terminating in a seat 72 adapted to contain therein sealing means as in the form of an o-ring 74 as hereinafter explained. Communicating with the bore 71 is a longitudinally extending passageway 76 that extends to the front tip 66 of the transmission 65 through the front section 75, which is illustrated tohave a curved or contoured portion 78 to permit ready access within the oral cavity. Obviously, the shape, contour and cross sectional area of the passageway 76 may be designed to obtain various spray patterns or flow rates and further, the tip 66 may be designed so as to obtain flexural, lateral, torsional, elliptical, linear or longitudinal motion, by proper control of the shape of the front section of the transmission member which has the bent tip portion 78 formed therewith. 
 The transmission member 65 has a contoured radius 79 connecting together the front section 75 and the rear section 70 of the transmission member 65, which sections may be both of circular cross sectional area such that the front section 75 extends out beyond the front end 54 of the housing 52 a sufiicient distance and through the opening 62 provided therefor. The transmission member 65 may contain an annular depression 80 for motor mounting means, illustrated to be in the form of an o-ring 81, but it may take other forms and shapes as desired. Extending from the rear face 68 of the transmission member 65 is a support member or shaft 82 having a threaded portion 84 which engages the threaded portion 71 of the transmission member 65 and an axially extending passageway or opening 83. The rear end of the support member 82 also has a threaded portion 86 which receives locking means in the form of a nut threaded thereon and adapted to sandwich therebetween under a selected compressive static load a pair of piezoelectric crystals 88 and 89 that i may be of a lead zirconate or I ead'titanate ceramic tive crystals 88 and 89 have a diameter which permits an insulating tubular sleeve 96 to be positioned in surrounding relationship over the support member 82, and extends the length from the front face 98 of crystal 88 to the rear face 101 of the crystal 89. The sleeve 96 is made preferably from an insulative material such as plastic so as to isolate the crystals from the electrode that extends between the rear face 99 of crystal 88 and the front face of crystal 100 of crystal 89. 
 To permit wiring of the motor, wire lead 104 extends through the passageway 83 with the'support member 82 having a longitudinally extending opening 102 through the support member wall and through an opening 105 in the insulator sleeve 96 and terminating in a pocket 106 within the disc shaped electrode 90. The 
wire 104 is soldered or otherwise attached to the electrode 90 for electrical purposes. The rear member 91 fits in telescopic relationship to the support member 82 and has an external diameter 108 which is less than the internal diameter of the chamber 60. 
 The mounting means for the motor in the housing means 52 consists of spaced apart o-rings 81 and 110 such that the vibrational energy of the motor when energized, remains substantially isolated therein without the energy being transmitted to the housing 52. A peripheral o-ring seat 109 is provided for o-ring 110 in the housing 52. 
 Locking means in the form of a nut 85 is secured to the rear threaded portion 86 on shaft 82 and is tightened to the point where an axial compressive force is sufficient to compress the crystal 88, electrode 90, crystal 89, and rear section 91 with a predetermined amount of torque. Depending upon the size of the crystals and power of the motor, an epoxy material may be used to bond the parts and crystals together and form the locking means. 
 As' part of the electrical connecting means, a ground lead or conductor 112 is connected to a lug 114, a portion of which extends beneath the nut 85, such that the power leads 104 and 112 are in turn connected to a power source as hereinafter explained. 
 The ultrasonic motor 50 although shown as piezoelectric may be one of a variety of electromechanical types, such as electrodynamic, piezoelectric or magnetostrictive. and designed for effecting ultrasonic vibrations through hand directed tools of suitable configuration, or larger ones, which are readily replaceable or interchangeable with other work performing tools or accessories such as for use as acoustically vibrated material treating devices. The motor 50 has components rigidly joined, in end-to-end relationship to form a unit or assembly which is removably supported in a housing containing electrical coupling means to the transducer and receiving alternating current. 
 The ultrasonic motor 50 is longitudinally dimensioned so as to have lengths which are generally whole multiples of half-wavelengths of .the compressional waves established therein at the frequency of the combined longitudinal length of the components so that longitudinal loops or other components of motion occur at the end 66 of the output surface of the transmission member 65. Thus, the optimum amplitude of longitudinal vibration and hyper-accelerations of transmission or coupling member is achieved, and such amplitude is determined by the relationship of the masses of the rear section and front section which may be made effective to either magnify or reduce the amplitude of the vibrations received from the transducer crystals. The front section 75 may be permanently attached to the rear section 70, or the front section 75, or part thereof, may be provided with a threaded stud adapted to be screwed into a tapped hole in the end of the transmission member 65 for effecting rigid connection of a removable element thereto. 
 The rear end 56 of the casing or housing 52 has an electric connector or plug 115 connected thereto by means of a bushing 116, which extends beyond the rear end of the housing 52 and may be secured thereto in any conventional manner. The connector 115 is seated at one end of the bushing 116 and adapted to mate with an opposite type connector 120; i.e., female, such that electrical energy may be transmitted to the motor 50. 
 The adapter 26 is designed to match the rear end of the housing 52 and includes a cavity 121 having a front end 122 which abuts the rear end 56 with a wall portion 123 having an external diameter 124 that may be of the same outside diameter as the housing 52. The female connector 120 is contained within a counterbore 125 having electrical contacts 126 and 128 and may be seated therein by a press fit such that the electrical terminals or prongs 129 and 130 and water feed 131 of the connector 115, as seen in FIGS. 5 and 6, are adapted to mate with the female receptacle 120 having receiving prongs or contacts 133, 134 and 138. The terminals 129, 130 and 131 extend from the front of the connector 115 and the two power leads 104 and 112 are connected to 129 and 130 respectively and, in turn, to prongs 133 and 134 which connect to contacts 126 and 128 respectively. The sleeve 116 extends in telescopic relation to the adapter 26 and by a frictional fit extends within a seat 132 on the front of adapter housing 26. The present embodiment of the ultrasonic motor system is adapted to have a fluid pass therethrough such that the instrument may be used as a water pick or dental prophylaxis unit and accordingly, fluid supply means 135 is provided in the form of a flexible tube or conduit 136 that extends through the sleeve 116 and is coupled to the receptacle 115 which in turn has its prong 131 that mates with prong 134 in receptacle 120 in a conventional manner. The conduit 136 extends from the receptacle 115 and through the axial bore 83 in the shaft 82 to be in axial alignment with the passageway 76 extending from the bottom surface or seat 72 to the tip 66 of the transmission member 65. The conduit 136 may abut the bottom of the seat 72 and be retained in place by sealing means in the form of an oring 137 to afford a structurally fluid tight seal. Other means of coupling the front to the fluid connecting member 136 may be utilized in order to have a continuous flow of fluid, such as water, from a desired source, which may be from a tap or a mechanical pump as discussed with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2, for maintaining a stream of fluid on a continuous or intermittent basis. 
The vibratory mechanical energy generated in the motor is in turn transmitted to the fluid through the front member as discussed in accordance with US. Pat. No. 3,547,l IO. 1*{bb DIE/w t 6;}? 
 The contacts 126 and 128 have wires 40 and 141 connected thereto and liquid conduit 142 connects to terminal 134, with all being contained within a flexible sheath 145 and together forming cable 24. A stop member 146 firmly grips the sheath 145 and memers therein. 
 FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate an ultrasonic kit 10a of a similar nature to that illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, except that the entire kit 10a is situated within a cabinet 12a that is built within the wall 14a of the home of the user 11a and access to the accessories 25a as well as the power On-Off switch 28a, power regulation 30a and fluid regulator switch 320 are obtained by opening the door 1500 to the cabinet 12a. As seen in particular with respect to FIG. 8, the cabinet 120 contains a lower shelf 130 or wall having a plurality of openings 33a and each opening adapted to receive therein an accessory 250 which may be of the type discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2. The upper portion of the cabinet 12a contains an upper wall 151a and a front panel 152a through which the knob control switches 28a, 30a and 32a extend with the converter a positioned on the upper wall 151a and connected to the normal house current via cable 45a and plug 46a. An electrical power cable 154a extends from the converter 15a through the upper wall 151a and through a middle wall 155a, which latter wall supports the reservoir 16a which, as seen in FIG-3 may be readily removed for replenishing the supply of liquid therein. The bottom of the reservoir 16a is coupled to a fitting 156a in which the power cable [540 is connected to, and fluid supply and power supply merge into cable 240, and are then wound on a spring loaded or other commercially type available take-up or retracting means in the form of a reel 1600 such that the adapter 260 from its retracted position as seen in FIG. 8 is retained in place by supporting means 35 with support arms or clips 36a, mounted on panel 1610 to its extended position as seen in FIG. 7 so that it is ready for use by the user lla. The manner of operation is similar to that described in FIGS. 1 and 2, and by supplying a spring loaded take-up reel 160a, the problems of a loose cable 240 are eliminated. 
 FIGS. 9-13 illustrate another form of accessory 25b and adapter 26b thatmay be utilized in accordance with the embodiments of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, and 7 and 8, and having an added feature of a removable element l65b. The accessory 25b includes an ultrasonic motor or transducer means 50b contained in a tubular housing 52b having a front end 54!; and a rear end 56b with the outer wall 58b of the housing 52b having any desired contoured shape or configuration to facilitate it being handled by the user, and a tapered section 59b terminating at the front end 54b of the housing 52b with a chamber or cavity means 60b extending from the rear end 56b of the housing 52b and connected to an axial opening 62b which in turn terminates at the front end 54b. 
 As seen with respect to FIG. 10, the ultrasonic motor 50b is contained within the housing cavity 60b and the hand piece housing 52b may be of plastic or any other suitable material. The ultrasonic motor 50b includes a transmission member 65b terminating at a working output end or tip 66b at one end thereof and having a rear surface or face 68b at its opposite end. The transmission member 65b may be designed in the form of an acoustical impedance transformer so that there is an increase in the amplitude of mechanical vibration from its rear face 68b to its front tip 66b. The actual variations of cross sectional area to obtain the amplitude magnification is well known in the art. The transmission member 65b may be of a metallic or plastic material depending upon its desired use with the removable element l65b having a water feed through as shown in F IG. 4; then the unit may be used for dentistry in the form of a dental prophylaxis unit by the dentist or in turn may be of a home consumer design to be used by the user in the home for maintaining tooth and gingival surfaces free of deposits normally contained on the teeth of the user. Essentially, the motor construction, as hereinafter described, for professional and home use, may be of similar design except that the relative power for a home consumer unit would be less than that of a professional unit which is used by the dentist, since in the home the user is in a sense doing over a 6- month period what the dentist might be doing at one sitting in the dentist's office. Accordingly, the removable element 165b may be of a plastic or metallic material depending upon the use thereof and the magnitude of ultrasonic mechanical vibrations to be imparted thereto. 
 The transmission member 65b has a contoured radius 79b connecting together the front section 75b and the rear section 70!) of the transmission member 65b, which sections may be both of circular cross sectional area such that the front section b extends out beyond the front end 54b of the housing 52b a sufficient distance and through the opening 62b provided therefor. 
 The transmission member 65b may contain an annular depression b and casing 52b with an annular depression 166b, for motor mounting means, illustrated to be in the form of an o-ring 81, positioned in each of said depressions. Extending from the rear face 68b of the transmission member 65b is a support member or shaft 82b that may be integrally formed therewith, and having an axially extending passageway or opening 83b. The rear end of the support member 82b has a threaded portion 86b which receives locking means in the form of a nut b threaded thereon and adapted to sandwich therebetween under a selected compressive static load a pair of driving piezoelectric crystals 88b and 89b and a third crystal 168b forming part of the sensing means, that may be of a lead zirconator'or lead titanate ceramic crystal material, formed so as to be either capable of ultrasonic vibrational activity in its longitudinal direction when activated by high frequency electrical impulses delivered to it, or detecting the frequency of the motor, as will be described. The driving crystals have an external diameter 92b and 93b respectively, which is smaller than the internal diameter of the chamber 60b such that sufficient clearance therebetween is obtained. The internal diameters 94b and 95b of the respective crystals 88b and 89b have a diameter which permits an insulating tubular sleeve 96b to be positioned in surrounding relationship over the support member 82b, and extends the length from the front face 98b of crystal 88b to at least the rear face l0lb of the crystal 89b. The sleeve 96b is made preferably from an insulative material such as plastic so as to isolate the crystals from the electrode b that extends between the rear face 99b of crystal 88b and the front face of crystal 10% of crystal 89b. 
 To permit wiring of the motor, wire lead l04b extends through the passageway 83b with the support member 82b having a longitudinally extending opening l02b through the support member wall and through an opening l05b in the insulator sleeve 96b and terminating in a pocket 106b within the disc shaped electrode 90b. The wire 104k is soldered or otherwise attached to the electrode 90b for electrical purposes. The rear member 91b tits in telescopic relationship to the support member 82b and has an external diameter'l08b which is less than the internal diameter of the chamber 60b. 
 A peripheral o-ring seat 10% is provided on the support member 82b and an o-ring seat 16% is provided in the cavity 80b for o-ring l10b such that the mounting means for the motor 50b in the housing means 52b consists of spaced apart o-rings 81b and 11% such that the vibrational energy of the motor when energized, remains substantially isolated therein without the energy being transmitted to the housing 52b.

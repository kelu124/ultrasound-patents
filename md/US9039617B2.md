FIELD OF INVENTION
Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to therapeutic treatment systems, and more particularly, to methods and systems for generating thermal bubbles for improved ultrasound imaging and therapy.
BACKGROUND
Ultrasound has long been used for diagnostic imaging applications. More recently however, several new therapeutic applications for ultrasound are being discovered.
SUMMARY
Various embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system uniquely capable of generating thermal bubbles for improved ultrasound imaging and therapy.
In various embodiments, the physical mechanisms for generating thermal bubbles can comprise one or more of the following: (1) selective absorption of ultrasound energy within a bubbly medium due to enhanced attenuation from scattering; (2) enhanced thermal gradient in a micro-bubble rich region due to enhanced viscous losses from stable cavitation; (3) enhanced thermal response due to ultrasound-gas-vapor voids; and (4) enhanced deposition of thermal energy from inertial cavitation events.
In various embodiments, providing ultrasound energy to cell membranes or tissues with thermal bubbles ultrasound imaging and therapy. For example, in various embodiments, the permeability and/or transparency of cell membranes can be modulated. For example, in some embodiments, the permeability and/or transparency of cell membranes is increased. In some embodiments, heating can cause better diffusion of a material or a drug through the layers of skin tissue. Cavitation and radiation force involves sustained oscillatory motion of bubbles (a.k.a. stable cavitation) and/or rapid growth and collapse of bubbles (a.k.a. inertial cavitation). Resulting fluid velocities, shear forces and shock waves can disrupt cell membranes or tissues and induce chemical changes in the surrounding medium. The collapse of bubbles can additionally increase the bubble core temperature and induce chemical changes in the medium (e.g., generate highly reactive species, such as free radicals). Each of the above effects can impact ultrasound imaging and therapy effectiveness. In addition, other ways to impact ultrasound imaging and therapy include melting or mechanically disrupting thermally sensitive or mechanically fragile substances, such as medicant-carrying liposomes and/or other chemical loaded, gas or liquid filled stabilized spheres, analogous to local delivery.
In some embodiments, ultrasound imaging and therapy can be enhanced when shock waves generated upon collapse of bubbles disrupt the stratum corneum and thereby enhance skin permeability. Likewise, ultrasound imaging and therapy effectiveness can be enhanced when shock waves transiently compromise the integrity of cell membranes or tissues, or when local free-radical concentration enhances medicant toxicity. Moreover, certain medicants can be activated and/or released using energy. In that regard, a medicant encapsulated in a carrier can be released at the site of interest using energy (e.g., acoustic energy). For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,623,430, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Safely Delivering Medicants to a Region of Tissue Using Imaging, Therapy and Temperature Monitoring Ultrasonic System”, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
In various embodiments, a region of interest (or “ROI”) is located within one of the nonviable epidermis (i.e., the stratum corneum), the viable epidermis, the dermis, the subcutaneous connective tissue and fat, and the muscle. Depths may be in the range of about 0 mm to about 3 mm, 5 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 25 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, or 100 mm or more. In accordance with various embodiments, the ROT is located about 20 mm to about 30 mm below the stratum corneum. Further, a plurality of ROI can be treated, and in some embodiments, simultaneously. For example, the ROI may consist of one or more organs or a combination of tissues either superficial or deep within the body.
In various embodiments, the method and system is uniquely capable of disrupting cell membranes or tissues and inducing chemical changes in the surrounding medium at either a single or multiple layers of skin tissue simultaneously (e.g., a plurality of depths within a cell membrane or tissue simultaneously). For example, in one embodiment, one frequency of acoustic energy at one skin layer might generate shock waves upon collapse of bubbles to disrupt the stratum corneum and thereby enhance skin permeability. A different frequency of acoustic energy at a different skin layer might simply provide heat to cause better diffusion of medicants through the layers of skin tissue. Yet another frequency of acoustic energy at a different skin layer might compromise the integrity of cell membranes or tissues, or generate local free-radicals to enhance or reduce medicant toxicity. In various embodiments, acoustic energy can be deposited in three-dimensions and at variable depths to selectively increase tissue permeability to thereby steer or guide the medicant through the tissue to a region of interest.
In various embodiments, the methods and systems disclosed herein contemplate the use of unfocused, focused, or defocused acoustic energy at variable spatial and/or temporal energy settings, in the range of about 1 kHz-100 MHz (e.g. about 1 kHz-50 kHz, 50 kHz-100 kHz, 100 kHz-500 kHz, 500 kHz-1 MHz, 3 MHz-7 MHz, 1 MHz-20 MHz, 1 MHz-10 MHz, 10 MHz-50 MHz, and/or 50 MHz-100 MHz, and any ranges or combinations of ranges), and at variable tissue depths. In various embodiments, the tissue depth can include, but are not limited to, 0-1 mm, 1 mm-2 mm, 2 mm-3 mm, 3 mm-4 mm, 4 mm-5 mm, 5 mm-6 mm, 6 mm-7 mm, 7 mm-8 mm, and 8 mm or more, and any ranges or combinations of ranges. The unique ability to customize acoustic energy output and target a particular region of interest makes possible highly accurate and precise thermal bubble formation.
In various embodiments, a system comprises a probe, a control system, and a display or indicator system. The probe can comprise various probe and/or transducer configurations, In various embodiments, the probe delivers unfocused, focused, or defocused ultrasound energy to the region of interest. Imaging and/or monitoring may alternatively be coupled and/or co-housed with a system contemplated by embodiments of the present invention.
In various embodiments, the control system and display system can also optionally comprise various configurations for controlling probe and system functionality, including for example, a microprocessor with software and a plurality of input/output devices, a system for controlling electronic and/or mechanical scanning and/or multiplexing of transducers, a system for power delivery, systems fir monitoring, systems for sensing the spatial position of the probe and/or transducers, and systems for handling user input and recording treatment results, among others.
In various embodiments, a system for generating thermal bubbles for improved ultrasound imaging and therapy includes a control system configured for control of the system, a probe configured for generating thermal bubbles, and a display system.
In various embodiments, a system for imaging thermal bubbles includes a control system configured for control of the system, a probe configured for imaging thermal bubbles, and a display system.
In various embodiments, a method for generating thermal bubbles for improved ultrasound imaging and therapy includes the steps of providing a source of acoustic energy, coupling the acoustic energy to a region of interest, and focusing the acoustic energy to the region of interest to generate thermal bubbles, wherein the source frequency of the acoustic energy is in the range of about 10 kHz to about 30 MHz.
In various embodiments, a method for generating thermal bubbles to evoke a cellular response includes the steps of providing a source of acoustic energy, coupling the acoustic energy to a region of interest; and focusing the acoustic energy to the region of interest to generate thermal bubbles, wherein the source frequency of the acoustic energy is in the range of about 10 kHz to about 30 MHz (e.g., about 10 kHz-50 kHz, 50 kHz-100 kHz, 100 kHz-500 kHz, 500 kHz-1 MHz, 1 MHz-10 MHz, and/or 10 MHz-30 MHz or overlapping ranges therein), and evoking a cellular response. In various embodiments the cellular response comprises one or more of a wound healing response, an immune histological response, heat-shock protein expression, programmed cell death, wound debridement, keloid/scar healing, and increased localized micro-circulation.
In various embodiments, a method for generating thermal bubbles to affect a chemical moiety includes the steps of providing a source of acoustic energy, coupling the acoustic energy to a region of interest; and focusing the acoustic energy to the region of interest to generate thermal bubbles, wherein the source frequency of the acoustic energy is in the range of about 10 kHz to about 30 MHz (e.g., about 10 kHz-50 kHz, 50 kHz-100 kHz, 100 kHz-500 kHz, 500 kHz-1 MHz, 1 MHz-10 MHz, and/or 10 MHz-30 MHz, or overlapping ranges therein) and evoking an effect on a chemical moiety. In various embodiments, the effect includes enhancing the delivery or augmenting the activation of the chemical moiety.
In various embodiments, a method for optimization of therapy includes concomitant monitoring of bubble activity by monitoring (a) one or more non-thermal responses, (b) one or more thermal responses and/or (c) one or more tissue property changes.
In several embodiments, the systems (and methods thereof) comprise the use of thermal bubbles in which the source frequency of the acoustic energy is about 1-10 MHz for therapy (e.g., 4 or 7 MHz) and 5-25 MHz for imaging (e.g., 18 MHz).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Several embodiments of the present invention may be described herein in terms of various functional components and processing steps. It should be appreciated that such components and steps may be realized by any number of hardware components configured to perform the specified functions and processes. For example, various embodiments of the present invention may employ various medical treatment devices, visual imaging and display devices, input terminals and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions and processes under the control of one or more control systems or other control devices. In addition, various embodiments of the present invention may be practiced in any number of medical contexts and the embodiments relating to a method and system for generating thermal bubbles for improved ultrasound imaging and therapy, as described herein, are merely indicative of embodiments of applications for the invention. For example, the principles, features and methods discussed may be applied to any medical application. Further, various aspects of embodiments of the present invention may be suitably applied to other applications.
In various embodiments of systems, and as illustrated in FIG. 1, the physical mechanisms for generating thermal bubbles can comprise: (1) selective absorption of ultrasound energy within a bubbly medium due to enhanced attenuation from scattering; (2) enhanced thermal gradient in a micro-bubble rich region due to enhanced viscous losses from stable cavitation; (3) enhanced thermal response due to ultrasound-gas-vapor voids; and/or (4) enhanced deposition of thermal energy from inertial cavitation events.
Each one of these mechanisms can be modulated either individually or used in combination with a thermal tissue effect. In various embodiments, the source frequency is between 1 kHz-100 MHz, 5 kHz-50 MHz, and/or 10 kHz-30 MHz (e.g., about 1 kHz-50 kHz, 50 kHz-100 kHz, 100 kHz-500 kHz, 500 kHz-1 MHz, 1 MHz-10 MHz, and/or 10 MHz-30 MHz, or overlapping ranges therein).
In various embodiments, the activation source powers are dependent on the frequency, bubble size distribution, bubble density and tissue. For example, in some embodiments, the lower the frequency, the less intense field is required to initiate thermal bubble activity. In some embodiments, the higher the nominal bubble size, the lower the source frequency at which the gas bodies will resonate. In some embodiments, the higher the local concentration of gas bodies, the greater effect with thermal bubbles can be achieved.
A wide range of transducer design configurations are used in accordance with several embodiments, as further discussed below. These thermal bubble effects can also be leveraged to augmented imaging and treatment monitoring.
The methods and systems according to several embodiments disclosed herein contemplate the use of unfocused, focused, or defocused acoustic energy at variable spatial and/or temporal energy settings, in the range of about 1 kHz-100 MHz (e.g., about 1 kHz-50 kHz, 50 kHz-100 kHz, 100 kHz-500 kHz, 500 kHz-1 MHz, 1 MHz-10 MHz, 10 MHz-30 MHz, and/or 30 MHz-100 MHz, or overlapping ranges therein), and at variable tissue depths. The unique ability to customize acoustic energy output and target a particular region of interest makes possible highly accurate and precise thermal bubble formation.
In several embodiments, the energy is acoustic energy. In other embodiments, the energy is photon based energy (e.g., IPL, LED, laser, white light, etc., or combinations thereof), or other energy forms, such radio frequency electric currents (including monopolar and bipolar radio-frequency current). In an embodiment, the energy is various combinations of acoustic energy, photon based energy, electromagnetic energy and other energy forms or energy absorbers such as cooling.
One or more of a transducer and/or transduction element configuration, a lens, and mechanical movement of a transducer may facilitate targeting of a particular region of interest and/or thermal bubble formation at specific locations.
In accordance with a method according to several embodiments, thermal bubbles act as contrast agents (e.g., markers or boundaries) for ultrasound imaging and therapy. In this manner, a region of interest can be marked or defined such that acoustic energy can be locally applied at for example, a cell, tissue, gland, fiber, or tumor. A boundary can be in any two-dimensional or three-dimensional configuration suitable for defining a region of interest for acoustic energy deposition (e.g., circle, square, triangle, sphere, cube, cone, or any arbitrary shape). The acoustic energy deposited therein may be for any therapeutic purpose now known or later devised (e.g., for ablative or non-ablative purposes).
In accordance with another method, just as thermal bubbles are used as boundaries for acoustic energy inclusion, as described herein, thermal bubbles can be used as boundaries for acoustic energy exclusion. In other words, thermal bubbles can be used to protect or to avoid various cells, tissues, glands, fibers, and/or regions of even higher acoustic impedance or sensitivity, for example. In some embodiments, bubbles are used to partially or fully isolate a region of interest.
Because thermal bubbles exhibit high acoustic impedance, in accordance with some embodiments of a method, they are used to concentrate acoustic energy deposition within a region of interest. For example, thermal bubbles may be created in such a manner so as to “funnel” acoustic energy as it moves from the energy source to the region of interest, thereby concentrating acoustic energy at the deposition site. An acoustical impedance mismatch can be created between the thermal bubble and the surround tissue. This acoustical mismatch can cause acoustic energy traveling through tissue to reflect, deflect, and/or scatter upon contact with the thermal bubble.
In various embodiments, a method of providing non-invasive ultrasound treatment, can comprise coupling an acoustic source to a surface of skin; providing a first acoustic energy into a region of interest below the surface; creating thermal bubbles in a first portion of the region of interest; providing a second acoustic energy into a second portion of the region of interest; and stimulating a bio-effect in the second portion of the region of interest.
In one embodiment, the method can comprise forming a boundary comprising the thermal bubbles. In one embodiment, the method can comprise reflecting a portion of the second acoustic energy off of at least one of the thermal bubbles. In one embodiment, the method can comprise directing the portion of the second portion of the second acoustic energy away from tissue outside of the region of interest from the second acoustic energy. In one embodiment, the method can comprise protecting the tissue outside of the region of interest from the second acoustic energy. In one embodiment, the tissue outside of the region of interest comprises an internal organ.

In accordance with some methods, thermal bubbles are also particularly useful in preferential heating applications. For example, various cells, tissues, glands, fibers, and tumors can be either directly or indirectly therapeutically benefited by increases in temperature. And various therapeutic treatments, such as drug delivery, are facilitated by increases in temperature. Heating applications may be carried out alone or in combination with other thermal bubble applications and/or ultrasound imaging or therapy.
As mentioned above, collapse of cavitation bubbles can generate shock waves capable of disrupting cells and tissues and can induce chemical changes in the surrounding medium (e.g., generate highly reactive species, such as free radicals). Because some embodiments of the present invention enable highly accurate and precise thermal bubble formation, cells, tissues, glands, fibers, tumors, etc, can be selectively disrupted to accomplish various therapeutic applications, and various chemical changes can be induced at specific locations.
As noted above, each one of the abovementioned thermal bubble mechanisms can be modulated either individually or used in combination with a thermal tissue effect. In various embodiments, the combination effect of thermal tissue effects with the use of thermal bubbles effectuates and/or modulates a tissue response. In embodiments, use of bubble effects (inter-intracellular shear with a thermal tissue effect, e.g., thermal gradient), activates a wound healing response, an immune histological response, heat-shock protein expression and/or programmed cell death. In embodiments, tissue responses comprise wound debridement, keloid/scar healing, and increased localized micro-circulation.
In some embodiments, the thermal bubble response is maximized with the concomitant use of micro-bubble based formulations, emulsifiers, saponificants and/or emulsions. Thermal bubble use with other chemical moieties (e.g., analgesics, topical anesthetics, antibiotics, antibacterials, antimicrobials retinoids, etc.) may be useful to (1) enhance their delivery and/or (2) to augment their activation.
In some embodiments, selective tissue effects are achieved with a selective thermal-bubble response within one or more tissues (such as deep dermis, subcutaneous layers, etc). In other embodiments, selective tissue responses are enhanced within one or more glandular structures (such as sebaceous gland, sweat gland, hair follicle, etc.), by initiating a localized resonant cavity effect.
In accordance with some embodiments, optimization of therapy is accomplished using concomitant monitoring of bubble activity, for example, monitoring (a) one or more non-thermal responses (e.g., shear, inertial cavitation), (b) one or more thermal responses (e.g., vaporization) and/or (c) one or more tissue property changes. In accordance with one aspect of an embodiment, monitoring of bubble activity comprises imaging.
In various embodiments, the methods and systems for generating thermal bubbles for improved ultrasound imaging and therapy comprise delivering energy to a region of interest (“ROI”) within one or more layers of tissue. As mentioned above, in an embodiment, the energy is acoustic energy. In other embodiments, the energy is photon based energy (e.g., IPL, LED, laser, white light, etc.), or other energy forms, such radio frequency electric currents (including monopolar and bipolar radio-frequency current). In an embodiment, the energy is various combinations of acoustic energy, photon-based energy, electromagnetic energy and other energy forms or energy absorbers such as cooling.
In various embodiments, systems and/or methods are configured to produce one or more bio-effects. The term “bio-effects”, as used herein, shall be given its ordinary meaning and shall also mean biological effects and include, but not be limited to, effects on tissue (including in vivo, in vitro, in situ and ex vivo tissue), cells, organs and other body parts. Bio-effects include, but are not limited to, incapacitating, partially incapacitating, severing, rejuvenating, removing, ablating, micro-ablating, shortening, manipulating, or removing tissue either instantly or over time, and/or other effects, and/or combinations thereof. Bio-effects include, but are not limited to, tissue manipulation to e.g., facilitate aesthetic effects. Bio-effects also include, but are not limited to, tissue manipulation to e.g., enhance collagen formation or healing. Various bio-effects are further disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/857,989 filed Sep. 19, 2007, published as US2008/0071255, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference, herein. In various embodiments, treatment of a specific subcutaneous tissue to achieve a desired bio-effect uses ultrasound energy from system that may be directed to a specific depth within ROI to reach the targeted subcutaneous tissue. In one embodiment, a bio-effect is cutting tissue. In one embodiment, for example, if it is desired to cut muscle (by applying ultrasound energy at ablative levels), which is a distance below the surface of the skin, ultrasound energy from ultrasound system may be provided at ROI at a level to reach above, below, or approximately at the distance targeted at an ablative level which may be capable of ablating muscle.
In various embodiments, bio-effects may produce a clinical outcome such as a brow lift which can comprise elevating the patient's eyebrows and reducing wrinkles on the patient's brow or forehead region. In some embodiments, the clinical outcome may be the same or similar to traditional invasive surgery techniques, and may comprise the removal of wrinkles through a brow lift or replacement of treatment muscles and/or other tissue and subcutaneous tissue within the forehead (or other regions on the body) with muscle relaxant drugs.
In various embodiments, wrinkles can be partially or completely removed by applying ultrasound energy at ROI along the patient's forehead at levels causing the desired bio-effects. In various embodiments, bio-effects can comprise ablating, micro-ablating, coagulating, severing, partially incapacitating, shortening, removing, or otherwise manipulating tissue or subcutaneous tissue to achieve the desired effect. In various embodiments, method can be used to ablate, micro-ablate, or coagulate a specific tissue, or can be used as part of removing the subcutaneous tissue. Further, in one embodiment, muscle (such as the corrugator supercilii muscle) can be paralyzed and permanently disabled.
In various embodiments, systems and/or methods are configured to initiate and/or stimulate one or more biological responses. In various embodiments, biological responses can comprise, but are not limited to, diathermy, hemostasis, revascularization, angiogenesis, growth of interconnective tissue, tissue reformation, ablation of existing tissue, protein synthesis and/or enhanced cell permeability. Two or more of these biological responses may be combined to facilitate rejuvenation and/or treatment of superficial tissue. In various embodiments, responses to embodiments of systems or embodiments of methods are initiated and/or stimulated by effects can include any biological response initiated and/or stimulated by energy effects, such as, for example: 1) hemostasis, including that stimulated from concentrated ultrasound, 2) subsequent revascularization/angiogenesis, such as that generated from high frequency applications of approximately 2 MHz to 7 MHz or more, 3) growth of interconnective tissue, 4) reformation and/or ablation of existing tissue such as fat, collagen and others, 5) increased cell permeability that may facilitate the possibility of stimulated gene or medication therapy to tissue, and/or increased permeability of certain tissues to a variety of medications initiated by ultrasound frequencies 10 kHz to 10 MHz, 6) enhanced delivery and/or activation of medicants, 7) stimulation of protein synthesis and/or 8) any other possible tissue response such as coagulative necrosis. Thus, for example, in various embodiments, a low intensity dispersed ultrasound field can be generated to provide for angiogenesis, an increased intensity homogeneous or uniform ultrasound field can be generated to provide for diathermy that increases the rate of healing and rejuvenation, and/or high intensity focused and/or unfocused beams can be generated to provide for temporary ablative and hemostatic effects in a variety of depth and positions of human tissue, whereby a summation or a combined effect of rejuvenation is created by combining ultrasound energy fields.
With reference to FIG. 1, in various embodiments, ROI 12 is located within one of the nonviable epidermis (i.e., the stratum corneum), the viable epidermis, the viable dermis, the subcutaneous connective tissue and fat, and the muscle. Further, while only ROI 12 is illustrated, a plurality of ROIs can be treated, and in some embodiments, treated simultaneously. For example, ROI 12 may consist of or comprise of one or more organs or a combination of tissues or subcutaneous tissues, which are either superficial or located deep within the body.
In an embodiment, with reference to FIG. 2, an ultrasound system 14, comprising a control system 20, a probe 18, and a display system 22, is used to deliver first energy 4 and second energy 6 to at least a portion of ROI 12, such as, for example one or more of stratum corneum 85, viable epidermis 86, viable dermis 88, subcutaneous connective tissue and fat 82, and muscle 84. In various embodiments, at least one of first energy 4 and second energy 6 is provided by an acoustic transducer. In one embodiment, first energy 4 and second energy 6 are two different forms of ultrasound energy.
With continued reference to FIG. 2, in various embodiments, a probe 18 is a transducer that delivers first energy 4 and second energy 6 to ROI 12. Either or both of first energy 4 and second energy 6 may be used to produce thermal bubbles 8 or provide ultrasound imaging or therapy. For example, acoustic energy 4 might create a thermal bubble 8 marker or boundary, or “funnel,” while acoustic energy 6 provides ultrasound therapy directed to the marker or within the boundary.
In an embodiment, suction is used to attach probe 18 to the patient's body. In this embodiment, a negative pressure differential is created, which enables, probe 18 to attach to stratum corneum 85 by suction. A vacuum-type device can be used to create the suction and the vacuum device can be integral with, detachably connected to, or completely separate from probe 18. Using suction to attach probe 18 to stratum corneum 85 I ensures that probe 18 is properly coupled to stratum corneum 85. Further, using suction to attach probe 18 also reduces the thickness of the tissue to make it easier to reach distinct layers of tissue.
Turning now to the embodiments illustrated in FIG. 3, a system 14 may be capable of emitting ultrasound energy that is focused, unfocused or defocused to treat skin and/or subcutaneous tissue within ROI 12. System 14 may comprise a probe 18, a control system 20, and a display 22. System 14 may be used to delivery energy to, and/or monitor, ROI 12.
With reference to FIGS. 4A-4E, illustrates various embodiments of an acoustic transducer 19 capable of emitting ultrasound energy. This may heat ROI 12 at a specific depth to target a specific tissue or subcutaneous tissue causing that tissue to be ablated, micro-ablated, coagulated, incapacitated, partially incapacitated, rejuvenated, shortened, paralyzed, or removed.
A coupling gel may be used to couple probe 18 to ROI 12 at a surface of stratum corneum 85, for example, a surface of a patient's skin. Ultrasound energy may be emitted in various energy fields in this embodiment. With additional reference to FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B and in this embodiment, the energy fields may be focused, defocused, and/or made substantially planar by transducer 19, to provide many different effects. Energy may be applied in a C-plane or C-scan. For example, in one embodiment, a substantially planar energy field may provide a heating and/or pretreatment effect, a focused energy field may provide a more concentrated source of heat or hypothermal effect, and a non-focused energy field may provide diffused heating effects. It should be noted that the term “non-focused” as used throughout encompasses energy that is unfocused or defocused.
In another embodiment, a transducer 19 may be capable of emitting ultrasound energy for imaging or treatment or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, transducer 19 may be configured to emit ultrasound energy at specific depths in ROI 12 to target a specific tissue. In this embodiment, transducer 19 may be capable of emitting unfocused or defocused ultrasound energy over a wide area in and/or around ROI 12 for treatment purposes.
In various embodiments, a transducer 19 may comprise one or more transduction elements 26 for facilitating treatment. Transducer 19 may further comprise one or more transduction elements 26, such as, for example, elements 26A and 26B as illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B. One or more transduction elements 26 may comprise piezoelectrically active material, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), or other piezoelectrically active material such as, but not limited to, a piezoelectric ceramic, crystal, plastic, and/or composite materials, as well as lithium niobate, lead titanate, barium titanate, and/or lead metaniobate. In addition to, or instead of, a piezoelectrically active material, one or more transduction elements 26 may comprise any other materials configured for generating radiation and/or acoustical energy. Transducer 19 may also comprise one or more matching and/or backing layers coupled to the piezoelectrically active material of the one or more transduction elements 26. Transducer 19 may also be configured with single or multiple damping elements along the one or more transduction element 26.
In an embodiment, the thickness of the transduction element 26 of transducer 19 may be configured to be uniform. That is, the transduction element 26 may be configured to have a thickness that is generally substantially the same throughout.
In another embodiment, the transduction element 26 may also be configured with a variable thickness, and/or as a multiple damped device. For example, the transduction element 26 of transducer 19 may be configured to have a first thickness selected to provide a center operating frequency of a lower range, for example from approximately 1 kHz to 3 MHz. The transduction element 26 may also be configured with a second thickness selected to provide a center operating frequency of a higher range, for example from approximately 3 to 100 MHz or more.
In yet another embodiment, transducer 19 may be configured as a single broadband transducer excited with two or more frequencies to provide an adequate output for raising the temperature within ROI 12 to the desired level. Transducer 19 may also be configured as two or more individual transducers, wherein each transducer 19 may comprise a transduction element 26. The thickness of the transduction elements 26 may be configured to provide center-operating frequencies in a desired treatment range. For example, in an embodiment, transducer 19 may comprise a first transducer 19 configured with a first transduction element 26A having a thickness corresponding to a center frequency range of approximately 1 MHz to 3 MHz, and a second transducer 19 configured with a second transduction element 26B having a thickness corresponding to a center frequency of approximately 3 MHz to 100 MHz or more. Various other ranges of thickness for a first and/or second transduction element 26 can also be realized.
Moreover, in an embodiment, any variety of mechanical lenses or variable focus lenses, e.g. liquid-filled lenses, may also be used to focus and or defocus the energy field. For example, with reference to the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 4A and 4B, transducer 19 may also be configured with an electronic focusing array 24 in combination with one or more transduction elements 26 to facilitate increased flexibility in treating ROI 12. Focusing array 24 may be configured as an array of electronic apertures that may be operated by a variety of phases via variable electronic time delays, for example, T1, T2, T3 1. By the term “operated,” the electronic apertures of array 24 may be manipulated, driven, used, and/or configured to produce and/or deliver energy in a manner corresponding to the phase variation caused by the electronic time delay. For example, these phase variations may be used to deliver defocused beams, planar beams, and/or focused beams, each of which may be used in combination to achieve different physiological effects in ROI 12.
In various embodiments, transduction elements 26 may be configured to be concave, convex, and/or planar. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4A, transduction elements 26A and 26B are configured to be concave in order to provide focused energy for treatment within at least a portion of ROI 12. Additional embodiments are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/944,500, entitled “System and Method for Variable Depth Ultrasound Treatment,” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
In another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 4B, transduction elements 26A and 26B may be configured to be substantially flat in order to provide substantially uniform energy to RO 12. While FIGS. 4A and 41 illustrate embodiments with transduction elements 26 configured as concave and substantially flat, respectively, transduction elements 26 may be configured to be concave, convex, and/or substantially flat. In addition, transduction elements 26 may be configured to be any combination of concave, convex, and/or substantially flat structures. For example, a first transduction element 26 may be configured to be concave, while a second transduction element 26 may be configured to be substantially flat.
Moreover, transduction element 26 can be any distance from the patient's skin. In that regard, it can be far away from the skin disposed within a long transducer or it can be just a few millimeters from the surface of the patient's skin. In certain embodiments, the transduction element 26 can be positioned closer to the surface of a patient's skin when emitting ultrasound at high frequencies. Moreover, both three and two dimensional arrays of elements can be used in the present invention.
With reference to FIGS. 4C and 4D, transducer 19 may also be configured as an annular array to provide planar, focused and/or defocused acoustical energy. For example, in an embodiment, an annular array 28 may comprise a plurality of rings 30, 32, 34 to N. Rings 30, 32, 34 to N may be mechanically and electrically isolated into a set of individual elements, and may create planar, focused, or defocused waves. For example, such waves can be centered on-axis, such as by methods of adjusting corresponding transmit and/or receive delays, T1, T2, T3 . . . TN. An electronic focus may be suitably moved along various depth positions, and may enable variable strength or beam tightness, while an electronic defocus may have varying amounts of defocusing. In an embodiment, a lens and/or convex or concave shaped annular array 28 may also be provided to aid focusing or defocusing such that any time differential delays can be reduced. Movement of annular array 28 in one, two or three-dimensions, or along any path, such as through use of probes and/or any conventional robotic arm mechanisms, may be implemented to scan and/or treat a volume or any corresponding space within ROI 12.
With reference to FIG. 4E, another embodiment of a transducer 19 can be configured to comprise a spherically focused single element 36, annular/multi-element 38, annular with imaging region(s) 40, line-focused single element 42, 1-D linear array 44, 1-D curved (convex/concave) linear array 46, and/or 2-D array 48, combined with mechanical focus 50, convex lens focus 52, concave lens focus 54, compound/multiple lens focused 56, and/or planar array form 58 to achieve focused, unfocused, or defocused sound fields for at least one of imaging and therapy.
Transducer 19 may further comprise a reflective surface, tip, or area at the end of the transducer 19 that emits ultrasound energy. This reflective surface may enhance, magnify, or otherwise change ultrasound energy emitted from system 14.
In various embodiments, a probe 18 may be suitably controlled and operated in various manners by control system 20 as illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3 and 5A-5C which processes and sends one or more images obtained by transducer 19 to display 22. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5C: control system 20 may be capable of coordination and control of the entire treatment process to achieve the desired effect on tissue within ROI 12. For example, in an embodiment, control system 20 may comprise power source components 60, sensing and monitoring components 62, cooling and coupling controls 64, and/or processing and control logic components 66. Control system 20 may be configured and optimized in a variety of ways with more or less subsystems and components to implement the system 14 for controlled targeting of the desired tissue in ROI 12.
For example, in various embodiments of power sourcing components 60, control system 20 may comprise one or more direct current (DC) power supplies 68 capable of providing electrical energy for the entire control system 20, including power required by a transducer electronic amplifier/driver 70. A DC current sense device 72 may also be provided to confirm the level of power entering amplifiers/drivers 70 for safety and monitoring purposes, among others.
In an embodiment, amplifiers/drivers 70 may comprise multi-channel or single channel power amplifiers and/or drivers. In an embodiment for transducer array configurations, amplifiers/drivers 70 may also be configured with a beamformer to facilitate array focusing. In various embodiments, a beamformer may be electrically excited by an oscillator/digitally controlled waveform synthesizer 74 with related switching logic.
Power sourcing components 60 may also comprise various filtering configurations 76. For example, switchable harmonic filters and/or matching may be used at the output of amplifier/driver 70 to increase the drive efficiency and effectiveness. Power detection components 78 may also be included to confirm appropriate operation and calibration. For example, electric power and other energy detection components 78 may be used to monitor the amount of power entering probe 18.
Various sensing and monitoring components 62 may also be suitably implemented within control system 20. For example, in an embodiment, monitoring, sensing, and interface control components 80 may be capable of operating with various motion detection systems implemented within probe 18, to receive and process information such as acoustic or other spatial and temporal information from ROI 12. Sensing and monitoring components 62 may also comprise various controls, interfacing, and switches 82 and/or power detectors 78. Such sensing and monitoring components 62 may facilitate open-loop and/or closed-loop feedback systems within treatment system 14.
In an embodiment, sensing and monitoring components 62 may further comprise a sensor that may be connected to an audio or visual alarm system to prevent overuse of system 14. In this embodiment, the sensor may be capable of sensing the amount of energy transferred to the skin, and/or the time that system 14 has been actively emitting energy. When a certain time or temperature threshold has been reached, the alarm may sound an audible alarm, or cause a visual indicator to activate to alert the user that a threshold has been reached. This may prevent overuse of the system 14. In an embodiment, the sensor may be operatively connected to control system 20 and force control system 20, to stop emitting ultrasound energy from transducer 19.
In an embodiment, a cooling/coupling control system 84 may be provided, and may be capable of removing waste heat from probe 18. Furthermore the cooling/coupling control system 84 may be capable of providing a controlled temperature at the superficial tissue interface and deeper into tissue, and/or provide acoustic coupling from probe 18 to ROI 12. Such cooling/coupling control systems 84 can also be capable of operating in both open-loop and/or closed-loop feedback arrangements with various coupling and feedback components.
Additionally, in various embodiments, an control system 20 may further comprise a system processor and various digital control logic 86, such as one or more of microcontrollers, microprocessors, field-programmable gate arrays, computer boards, and associated components, including firmware and control software 88, which may be capable of interfacing with user controls and interfacing circuits as well as input/output circuits and systems for communications, displays, interfacing, storage, documentation, and other useful functions. System software 88 may be capable of controlling all initialization, timing, level setting, monitoring, safety monitoring, and all other system functions required to accomplish user-defined treatment objectives. Further, various control switches 90 may also be suitably configured to control operation.
With reference to FIG. 5C, in various embodiments, a transducer 19 may be controlled and operated in various manners by a hand-held format control system 92. An external battery charger 94 can be used with rechargeable-type batteries 96 or the batteries can be single-use disposable types, such as AA-sized cells, Power converters 98 produce voltages suitable for powering a driver/feedback circuit 100 with tuning network 102 driving transducer 19 which is coupled to the patient via one or more acoustic coupling caps 104. Cap 104 can be composed of at least one of a solid media, semi-solid e.g. gelatinous media, and/or liquid media equivalent to an acoustic coupling agent (contained within a housing). Cap 104 is coupled to the patient with an acoustic coupling agent 106. In addition, a microcontroller and timing circuits 108 with associated software and algorithms provide control and user interfacing via a display 110, oscillator 112, and other input/output controls 114 such as switches and audio devices. A storage element 116, such as an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (“EEPROM”), secure EEPROM, tamper-proof EEPROM, or similar device holds calibration and usage data. A motion mechanism with feedback 118 can be suitably controlled to scan the transducer 19, if desirable, in a line or two-dimensional pattern and/or with variable depth. Other feedback controls comprise a capacitive, acoustic, or other coupling detection means and/or limiting controls 120 and thermal sensor 122. A combination of the secure EEPROM with at least one of coupling caps 104, transducer 19, thermal sensor 122, coupling detectors, or tuning network. Finally, a transducer can further comprise a disposable tip 124 that can be disposed of after contacting a patient and replaced for sanitary reasons.
With reference again to FIGS. 2, 3, and 5, in various embodiments, a system 14 also may comprise display 22 capable of providing images of ROI 12 in certain embodiments where ultrasound energy may be emitted from transducer 19 in a manner suitable for imaging. In an embodiment, display 22 is a computer monitor. Display 22 may be capable of enabling the user to facilitate localization of the treatment area and surrounding structures, e.g., identification of subcutaneous tissue and/or internal organs. In an alternative embodiment, the user may know the location of the specific target below a skin surface, which is to be treated. After localization, ultrasound energy is delivered at a depth, distribution, timing, and energy level to achieve the desired effect within ROI 12. Before, during and/or after delivery of ultrasound energy, monitoring of the treatment area and surrounding structures may be conducted to further plan and assess the results and/or provide feedback to control system 20, and to a system operator via display 22. In an embodiment, localization may be facilitated through ultrasound imaging that may be used to define the position of a target within ROI 12.
In various embodiments, for ultrasound energy delivery, transducer 19 may be mechanically and/or electronically scanned to place treatment zones over an extended area in ROI 12. A treatment depth may be adjusted between a range of approximately 1 to 30 millimeters, or any other depth described herein. Such delivery of energy may occur through imaging of the target, within ROI 12 and then applying ultrasound energy at known depths over an extended area without initial or ongoing imaging.
In various embodiments, the ultrasound beam from transducer 19 may be spatially and/or temporally controlled at least in part by changing the spatial parameters of transducer 19, such as the placement, distance, treatment depth and transducer 19 structure, as well as by changing the temporal parameters of transducer 19, such as the frequency, drive amplitude, and timing, with such control handled via control system 20. Such spatial and temporal parameters may also be suitably monitored and/or utilized in open-loop and/or closed-loop feedback systems within ultrasound system 14.
Finally, it should be noted that while this disclosure is directed primarily to using ultrasound energy to conduct procedures non-invasively, that the method and system described above can also utilize energy such as ultrasound energy to assist in invasive procedures. For example, ultrasound energy can be used to ablate tissues during an invasive procedure. In this regard, ultrasound energy can be used for invasive and minimally invasive procedures.
The present invention has been described herein with reference to various embodiments. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that changes and modifications may be made to any of the various embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the various operational steps, as well as the components for carrying out the operational steps, may be implemented in alternate ways depending upon the particular application or in consideration of any number of cost functions associated with the operation of the system, for example, various of the steps may be deleted, modified, or combined with other steps.
Further, it should be noted that while the methods and systems for ultrasound treatment, as described herein, are suitable for use by a medical practitioner proximate the patient, the system can also be accessed remotely, for example, the medical practitioner can view through a remote display having imaging information transmitted in various manners of communication, such as by satellite/wireless or by wired connections such as IP or digital cable networks and the like, and can direct a local practitioner as to the suitable placement for the transducer. Moreover, while the various embodiments may comprise non-invasive configurations, systems and methods can also be configured for at least some level of invasive treatment applications.
The various embodiments, as disclosed and illustrated herein, are not to be considered in a limiting sense as numerous variations are possible. The subject matter of the various embodiments of the invention includes any and all novel and non-obvious combinations and sub combinations of the various elements, features, functions and/or properties disclosed herein.

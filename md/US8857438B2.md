This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/411,251 filed on Nov. 8, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods for performing various treatments and/or imaging procedures safely and effectively by focusing on targeted tissue while shielding or protecting a non-targeted region. Cosmetic eye shields are provided in several embodiments.
2. Description of the Related Art
In certain instances, eye shields can protect a patient's eyes during various surgical procedures in which scalpels, electro-cauterizers or lasers are used to carry out the surgical procedures. Some eye shields protect the eyes from direct exposure to intense light from a light source during eye surgery, or from electron beams during electron beam treatment of eyelid tumors. However, such shields generally do not sufficiently protect the eyes, other non-target regions, such as, tissues, body parts, organs, medical devices, or medical implants from acoustic energy during an ultrasound treatment or imaging procedure.
SUMMARY
In several embodiments, the invention comprises a shield for use in energy-based therapeutic or imaging applications, in which the shield reduces energy transmission to non-target regions. Non-target regions include, but are not limited to, tissue and synthetic implants. In some embodiments, therapeutic ultrasound treatment (e.g., cosmetic enhancement) and/or imaging procedures are intended to affect targeted tissue. While the acoustic energy of ultrasound treatment or imaging procedures may be highly focused and localized in the targeted tissues or parts of the body often there exists residual acoustic energy levels beyond the focal point or outside the treatment or imaging region during these procedures. In some embodiments, it is necessary or desirable to protect or shield certain tissues, parts of the body, organs, medical devices, and/or medical implants not intended to be treated and/or imaged from acoustic energy during these ultrasound procedures. In various embodiments, acoustic transmission can be reduced by a shield through reflection, absorption, and/or diffraction. For example, according to one embodiment, it is desirable to protect the eyes from high levels of acoustic energy if a patient is undergoing enhancement procedures on, near, or around the eyelids.
There is a need for devices and procedures for protecting certain tissues, body parts, organs, medical devices, and/or medical implants from high levels of acoustic energy during an ultrasound treatment (e.g., cosmetic enhancement) and/or imaging procedure while permitting intended procedures on targeted tissue. In addition, there is a need for devices and procedures that meet the regulatory requirements for protection from unintended ultrasound exposure.
In various embodiments, a shield for protecting part of a subject's body from undesired exposure to acoustic energy is provided. In various embodiments, a shield can block, reduce, eliminate, redirect, absorb, convert, reflect, diffract, deflect, divert, disperse and/or reroute acoustic energy. In some embodiments, a shield is configured to protect an eye from exposure to acoustic energy. In some embodiments, a shield is configured to protect tissue from heating of the shield in absorbing or deflecting acoustic energy. In various embodiments, a shield is configured to address a thermal component of shielding acoustic energy. For example, in one embodiment, acoustic energy is blocked by a shield that absorbs some of the acoustic energy. In one embodiment, the shield reflects some or none of the acoustic energy. In some embodiments, acoustic energy may be converted to heat or electrical energy through a piezoelectric effect. In some embodiments, the shield includes an absorbing material with a high heat capacity, such that more energy is needed to raise the temperature of the absorber. In various embodiments, a shield reduces the thermal conductivity to surrounding tissue by absorbing with a high heat capacity, or by routing the heat away from the tissue through an energy diversion device. In some embodiments, the energy diversion device is an energy dispersion device, an electrical circuit, a heat conduit, a coolant channel, a heat exchanger, and/or a fluid configured to draw excess heat or energy from a shield. In some embodiments, a shield is configured for protecting tissue from undesired exposure to acoustic energy. In some embodiments, a shield is configured for protecting tissue from undesired exposure to acoustic energy as well as the potential heat generated from the acoustic energy.
In some embodiments, a multi-layered eye shield is configured for protecting a subject's eye from undesired exposure to acoustic energy. In some embodiments, the shield comprises at least a first layer, a second layer and a third layer. In one embodiment, the first and third layers are stainless steel, and the second (middle) layer is air. The first and third layers can be the same material or can be made of different materials. The middle layer and the outer layers have differential acoustic impedances in several embodiments. In various embodiments, the acoustic impedance ratio between two adjacent layers of the shield is at least 1,000:1, or 10,000:1, 50:000:1, or 100,000:1, or 250,000:1, or, 500,000:1, or 1,000,000:1, or 10,000,000:1, or approaching infinity, or infinite.
In one embodiment, the invention comprises a biocompatible shield that is configured to be sufficiently thin to fit under a patient's eyelids to protect the patient's eyes from high levels of acoustic energy while allowing the patient's eyelids or other tissues surrounding the eyes to be affected as intended during a cosmetic enhancement and/or imaging procedure. In various embodiments, a biocompatible shield is configured for use in protecting the eye from ultrasound energy during a blepharoplasty procedure. In various embodiments, the biocompatible shield may include one or more manipulation devices, handles, pinch grip, levers, suction devices, magnetic handles, or other similar gripping devices to aid in the placement and removal of the biocompatible shield from the patient's eyes. In various embodiments, the manipulation device is coupled, permanently coupled, temporarily coupled, and/or removably coupled to the shield. In one embodiment the manipulation device includes a tool that is detachable from the shield.
In some embodiments, the invention comprises a shield for protecting other body parts from ultrasonic exposure. Accordingly, several embodiments of the present invention provide an acoustic shielding system and a method for protecting and shielding certain tissues from levels of acoustic energy. In various embodiments, the acoustic shielding system includes a biocompatible shield interposed between an acoustic treatment system and non-target tissue that is not intended to be treated in order to shield the non-target tissue from acoustic energy.
A shield, according to one embodiment, comprises materials that provide high attenuation and/or acoustic impedance. In some embodiments, shields are made of materials that provide different or significantly different levels of attenuation and/or acoustic impedance. In various embodiments, shield materials have a reflection coefficient, wherein a reflection coefficient of 100% corresponds to complete reflection of energy, or 100% reflection. In various embodiments, shield materials have a reflection coefficient that is in a range of 10-100%, 25-100%, 50-100%, 60-100%, 65-100%, 70-100%, 75-100%, 80-100%, 85-100%, 90-100%, 95-100% or more. In some embodiments, the shields, and procedures thereof, may be configured to protect certain tissues, body parts, organs, medical devices, and/or medical implants from non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures employing energy, such as, for example, acoustic, ultrasound, laser, radiation, thermal, cryogenic, electron beam, photon-based, magnetic resonance or combinations thereof.
In several embodiments of the invention, one or more shields are used in non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures involving one or more of ultrasound, fluoroscopy, radiation (e.g., microwave) light, lasers, electricity, magnetic (e.g., magnetism, magnetic resonance) heating, and cooling. In one embodiment, one or more shields are used to shield a non-target region from the combined use of ultrasound energy and photon-based energy. In several embodiments, one or more shields are used to shield a non-target region from the combined use of ultrasound energy and at least one other energy, applied simultaneously or individually. For example, one or more shields may be used in procedures using combinations of ultrasound and laser, ultrasound and IPL (intense pulse light), ultrasound and radiofrequency, or ultrasound and magnetic energy. In one embodiment, non-metallic shields are used when procedures employ radiofrequency or magnetic energy (alone, together or in combination with ultrasound). In some embodiments, a shield is configured to shield non-target regions from at least one of two (or more) energy sources. For example, in combined therapies, a shield may shield against both ultrasound and photon-based energy, or may shield only ultrasound energy and not photon-based energy. In some embodiments of the invention, one or more shields, as disclosed herein, are used for focusing, reflecting and/or concentrating energy. The energy may comprise one or more of ultrasound, fluoroscopy, radiation, light, laser, photon-based, electricity, magnetic, heating, or cooling energy.

In various embodiments, the shield 100 can be configured for one-time use, reuse, configure to be sterilizable, autoclavable, and/or washable. In one embodiment, the shield 100 can include a coating, such as, for example, an anti-bacterial coating.

In some embodiments, the shield 100 can comprise a combination of metallic and non-metallic materials. For example, the shield 100 can comprise any number of metallic layers and a non-metallic layer is in contact with the patient to reduce or substantially eliminate transfer of thermal energy, and/or RF energy to tissue of the patient in contact with the shield. In one embodiment, the shield 100 is enabled for active cooling. In one embodiment, the shield 100 is enabled for active heating. In one embodiment, the shield 100 is configured with absorptive materials to absorb the energy and convert it to heat.

In one embodiment, materials 115, 125, 135, 155 are configured to reflect emitted energy 12 (e.g., ultrasound energy). In one embodiment, materials 115, 125, 135, 155 are configured to substantially cancel emitted energy 12 (e.g., ultrasound energy). In one embodiment, materials 115, 125, 135, 155 are configured to refract emitted energy 12 (e.g., ultrasound energy).

In one embodiment, materials 115, 125, 135, 155 are configured to absorb emitted energy 12 (e.g., ultrasound energy).
In various embodiments, the acoustic impedance of the shield 100 is configured to reduce or eliminate transmission of ultrasound energy to a non-target region 30. Acoustic impedance is a material property Z with units (M×L^−2×T^−1; N×s/m^3; or Pa×s/m). Acoustic impedance is the product of material density multiplied by the longitudinal wave speed, or sound speed in the material:

Z=ρ×V 

where ρ is the density of the medium (M×L^−3; kg/m^3), and
where V is the longitudinal wave speed or sound speed (L×T^−1; m/s).
When ultrasound energy travels between two or more materials 115, 125, 135, 155, one form of emitted wave energy 12 can be transformed into another form. For example, when a longitudinal wave hits an interface at an angle, some of the energy can cause particle movement in the transverse direction to start a shear (transverse) wave. Mode conversion occurs when a wave encounters an interface between materials of different acoustic impedances and the incident angle is not normal to the interface. A mode conversion occurs every time a wave encounters an interface at an angle, resulting in reflection or refraction of ultrasound energy between two or more layers 110, 120, 130, 150. When ultrasound energy waves pass through an interface between two or more materials 115, 125, 135, 155 having different acoustic velocities, refraction takes place at the interface. The larger the difference in acoustic velocities between the two or more materials 115, 125, 135, 155, the more the ultrasound energy is refracted or reflected. Thus, the greater the difference between the relative acoustic impedance between materials or layers in the shield 100, the more the shield 100 protects or diverts emitted energy 12 from non-target region 30.
The characteristic acoustic impedance of air at room temperature is about 420 Pa×s/m. By comparison the sound speed and density of water are much higher, resulting in an acoustic impedance of roughly 1.5 MPa×s/m, about 3,400-3,700 times higher than air. While air has an impedance of roughly 420 Pa×s/m, various relative acoustic impedance levels can be calculated with respect to air. Acoustic impedance levels can be calculated for any material, but to illustrate differences in acoustic impedance levels, FIG. 3 lists acoustic impedance of various materials in relative terms on a scale normalized to the acoustic impedance of air. As illustrated in FIG. 3, water has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 3,700 times higher than air. Aluminum has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 42,000 times higher than air. Glass has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 47,000 times higher than air. Gold has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 156,500 times higher than air. Polyethylene has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 4,250 times higher than air. Silver has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 95,000 times higher than air. Steel has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 115,000 times higher than air. Stainless steel has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 113,500 times higher than air. Tungsten has an acoustic impedance that is roughly 252,000 times higher than air. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude of at least 1,000. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude of at least 10,000. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude of at least 100,000. Air is used in some embodiments, but not used in others. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude of at least 250,000. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude of at least 1,000,000. For example, the shield 100 may comprise one or more adjacent layers of stainless steel and polyethylene. In various embodiments, the shield can comprise any one or combination of the materials listed at FIG. 3.
A vacuum, or lack of material or lack of air, can have an acoustic impedance level that approaches zero. Thus, the relative difference between any material when compared to air is further increased when compared to the near zero acoustic impedance of a vacuum. In one embodiment, one or more layers of the shield has an acoustic impedance, as normalized to the acoustic impedance of air, of zero, less than 1, less than about 10, less than about 100, or less than about 1,000. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude of at least 10,000,000. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude approaching infinity. In some embodiments, the shield 100 comprises one or more adjacent layers of materials that have an acoustic impedance that differ by a magnitude that is infinite.

In various embodiments, the relative difference of acoustic impedance values between any two materials 115, 125, 135 and 155 is at least a multiple or a factor of two, three, four, five, six through nine, ten, or more. In various embodiments, the relative difference of acoustic impedance values between any two adjacent materials 115, 125, 135, and 155 is a multiple or a factor in the range of 10-20; 20-50; 50-100; 100-500; 500-1,000; 1,000-10,000; 10,000-100,000; 100,000-1,000,000; 1,000,000-10,000,000; or 10,000,000 or more.

FIGS. 9A-9D illustrate an embodiment with a plurality of features 170 in the same plane, such that the cross section shows features 170 on two or more sides of a shield 100 that are aligned in a same plane (e.g. a plane that is parallel to the cross-sectional view). FIG. 9A illustrates one embodiment of a shield 100 with a plurality of concave features 170. FIG. 9B illustrates one embodiment of a shield 100 with a plurality of convex features 170.

FIG. 10D illustrates one embodiment of a shield 100 with a plurality of concave and convex features 170, 172 arranged in an out-of-phase configuration. As indicated by the broken lines in the illustrations at FIGS. 10A-10D, certain features 170 and 172 are not in the same plane.
 FIG. 11 illustrates various embodiments of a shield from a top view showing a number of features 170 and 172 that are arranged in various configurations such that certain features 170 are in different alignments from other features 172.
In some embodiments, one or more features 170 on a shield 100 reduce or prevent acoustic coupling. In some embodiments, the size of a feature 170 would be on the order of a wavelength to produce a scattering effect. In some embodiments, if the size of the feature 170 is larger than a wavelength, then each feature 170 acts more like a specular reflector. In various embodiments, features 170 may exist on one side, two, three, four, or more sides of the shield 100. The size, density and pattern of features 170 can be varied depending on the reflectivity requirements, wavelength used, and the possibility of moisture/water ingress into the pockets during treatment. In one embodiment, a shield 100 can include one or more features 170 that reduce and/or prevent moisture or water ingress during a procedure. Although various embodiments of feature 170 patterns can be aligned, it is also contemplated to have embodiments with random modifications to the surface finish that would also help increase the scattering or reduction of energy 12 transmission with respect to a non-target region 30.
In various embodiments, a shield 100 can de-focus an energy beam 12 that exits the shield 100. In one embodiment, a shield 100 comprises defocusing materials that further and more rapidly spread the energy 12. In one embodiment, if energy 12 is focused prior to the reflection off of the shield 100, then a top layer of the shield 100 may also be used to increase the overall spread of the reflection away from the non-target region 30.
In one embodiment, a shield 100 acts as an acoustic transmission line. In some embodiments, a shield 100 can use one or more materials that do not have a significant difference in impedance to tissue and still reduce acoustic transmission to safe levels. In one embodiment, for a shield 100 that approximates a lossless acoustic transmission line, the input impedance is given as:
       Z in  ⁡  ( l )   =   Z 0  ⁢    Z L  +   jZ 0  ⁢  tan ⁡  (  β ⁢     ⁢ l  )       Z 0  +   jZ L  ⁢  tan ⁡  (  β ⁢     ⁢ l  )        ,    or Z in(l)=Z 0×((Z L +jZ 0 tan(βl))/(Z 0 +jZ L tan(βl))

where ZL is the load impedance
where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line
where β is 2π/λ and
where l is the thickness of the shield.
In one embodiment, a shield 100 has a thickness (l) that is a multiple of half a wavelength and the input impedance is just ZL which is the acoustic impedance of tissue. In this case, it is as though the acoustic transmission line or shield 100 is not even present. In one embodiment, a shield 100 has a thickness (l) is half a wavelength. In this case, the input impedance is:
      Z in  =   Z 0 2   Z L    ,    or Z in =Z 0^2/Z L  
where ZL is the load impedance and
where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.
In one embodiment, although the characteristic impedance is roughly a factor of 2 different than water (e.g. 3 MRayls), the input impedance may be much higher, depending on the frequency and thickness. In one example, an embodiment of a shield is made of epoxy with an input effective impedance is 6 MRayls. In this case, the reflection coefficient is 60%, which is higher than the 33% predicted if the 3 MRayls was semi-infinite.
 FIG. 12 illustrates one embodiment of a shield 100 with an energy diversion device 230 that is configured to remove or dissipate energy 12, 12 that is absorbed by the shield 100. In some embodiments, acoustic energy 12 that is absorbed by the shield 100 is converted to heat. This heat can raise the temperature of the shield 100, causing discomfort or damage to any surrounding tissue. In some embodiments, the shield 100 includes an absorbing material with a high heat capacity, such that more energy is needed to raise the temperature of the absorbing material. In various embodiments, a shield 100 reduces the thermal conductivity to surrounding tissue by absorbing energy 12 with a high heat capacity, or by routing the heat away from the tissue through an energy diversion device 230. In various embodiments, the energy diversion device 230 is a heat conduit, a coolant channel, a heat exchanger, and/or a fluid circuit configured to draw excess heat or energy from the shield 100 and surrounding tissue.
In some embodiments, acoustic energy 12 that is absorbed by the shield 100 is converted to electrical energy. In some embodiments, acoustic energy 12 that is absorbed by the shield 100 is converted to electrical energy through a piezoelectric effect. In one embodiment, the shield 100 includes a piezoelectric sensor configured to absorb energy 12 and convert it in to an electrical signal. In various embodiments, the energy diversion device 230 is an electrical circuit.
In one embodiment, a shield 100 includes one or more acoustic sensors (piezoelectric) that may be used to give confirmation to a physician that energy 12 is being properly blocked, reduced, targeted, or aligned with the shield 100 with respect to target tissue 20 and/or a non-target region 30. In one embodiment, an acoustic sensor is a piezoelectric sensor. In one embodiment, one or more thermocouples may be added to and/or embedded in the shield 100 to monitor temperature, shield performance, heating, and/or proper positioning of the shield 100 with respect to target tissue 20 and/or a non-target region 30.
In various embodiments, a shield 100 can combine features or characteristics of any of the embodiments disclosed herein.
Example 1
The following example is intended to be a non-limiting embodiment of the invention.
As illustrated at FIGS. 13 and 14, it was experimentally verified that an embodiment of a multi-layered shield 100, which was placed between various ultrasound procedure systems 310—and non-target region 30, reduced or eliminated the transmission of ultrasound waves 12 to a non-target region 30. In the experiment, the shield 100 was constructed of a multi-layer stack of stainless steel, air, and stainless steel with a total thickness 1.40 mm. The shield 100 had a first layer 110 made of first material 115 stainless steel, a second layer 120 made of second material 125 air, and a third layer 130 made of third material 135 stainless steel. The purpose of the experiment was to quantify the residual level of acoustic power that could pass from a superficial ultrasound transducer through a multi-layered stainless steel layers into a non-target region 30 with sensors to measure ultrasonic transmission. Two different ultrasonic transducers were utilized in the respective ultrasonic procedure systems 310, a 7.5 MHz-3.0 mm focal depth ultrasonic transducer and a 10.5 MHz-2.0 mm focal depth ultrasonic transducer. The shield 100 was mounted 0.5 mm away from the surface of the respective ultrasonic transducer 310 with hot melt adhesive at the periphery of the shield 100. Power with and without the shield 100 was measured three times and averaged.
Two measurement methods were utilized: a hydrophone (measuring pressure) and radiation force balance (measuring acoustic power). In both cases emitted energy 12 was measured with and without the stainless steel stack shield 100. Transmission loss was evaluated as the ratio of power with the shield 100 to without the shield 100. The results of the experiment summarized at FIG. 14 show acoustic power measurements with the shield 100 in both cases with both types of ultrasonic transducers having a residual power transmission of 0 watts, within measurement limits of 150 mW, representing over 100× attenuation (>20 dB) compared to the 16 watt incident power. Hydrophone measurements reveal extreme attenuation of over 56 dB down (2.5 parts per million) which is at the noise floor of measurements. Without the multi-layer shield 100 in place, 15.6 watts of acoustic power was transmitted to the sensor with the 7.5 MHz-3.0 mm focal depth ultrasonic transducer and 14.6 watts of acoustic power was transmitted to the sensor with the 10.5 MHz-2.0 mm focal depth ultrasonic transducer.
Additionally, as illustrated in FIG. 14, experimental hydrophone measurements revealed attenuation of over 56 dB down with the multi-layer shield 100 in place. The ultrasonic transducers 310 were placed facing upward in a degassed water bath at room temperature. The entire apparatus was slightly inclined so that any air bubbles in the ultrasonic transducers 310 stay out of the acoustic path. A Dapco needle hydrophone mounted in a 3-axis micrometer adjustable stage was used to monitor intensity. A FET probe and narrowband (300 Hz) spectrum analyzer were used to measure the hydrophone voltage. The FET probe had a gain of −20 dB. Dynamic range was limited to −56 dB. With no intervening shield 100, the peak intensity was located by iteratively adjusting the XYZ stage. The shield 100 was then placed between one ultrasonic transducer 310 at a time and the hydrophone. Fine adjustments were then made to hydrophone position to relocate the highest intensity.
In one embodiment, no power (0 watts or 0%) of the 15-16 watt incident power was detected, within the lower limit of measurement resolution (±0.15 watts). Thus, according to several embodiments of the invention, the shield 100 was able to block 100% of acoustic energy. In other embodiments of the invention, the shield 100 blocks at least 99%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70% or 50% of undesired energy (including, but not limited to, ultrasound energy).
Some embodiments and the examples described herein are examples and not intended to be limiting in describing the full scope of compositions and methods of these invention.

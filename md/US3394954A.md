TUBE COUPLING FOR MEDICL APPLIANCES Filed Nay 6. 1966 ORNEYS United States Patent Ol 3,394,954 f v l TUBE COUPLING FOR MEDICAL APPLIANCES Richard N. Sarns, Ann Arbor, Mich., assignor to Sams, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich., a corporation of Michigan j Filed May 6, 1966, Ser. No. 548,152 3 Claims. (Cl. 285-319) ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE This invention rela-tes to an improved and substantially simplified design of a tube coupling device for medical appliances. In this invention a iirst molded plastic tube connector having an axial bore telescopically engages an end of a second tube connector having axially extending iiexible arms with an integral fulcrum, positioned to engage a central portion of one of the connectors with the arms being radially spaced -with respect to the central portion. One end of the arm overlies and engages a portion of the other connector in one position to prevent axial disengagement of the connectors and the arms and integral fulcrums are liexible to move radially outward to a disengaging position. 
Background ofthe invention This inventionrelates to an improved device for coupling conduits in medical appliances. In brief, this invention comprises male and female slidingly engageable couplers having a selectively disengageable latch arrangement to prevent accidental disengagement of th'e couplers. The latch mechanism consists of axially extending arms having an integral fulcrum with the arms being biased toward the engaged position by the inherent resiliency of the plastic material from which the integral arms and fulcrums are formed. In the preferred embodiment of this invention the arms and fulcru-ms are also an integral portion of one of the coupler elements. This invention also provides a quick-change coupler so that the tubes to which it is attached can be rapidly connected and disconnected. In many situations, such as blood transfusions, heart operations and treatments involving the functioning of the kidneys, there are many times when emergency action or rapid connection of devices utilizing incoming and outgoing lbodily liuids is of the utmost importance. 
 This invention relates to a tube coupling for medical appliances. 
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a device which can be utilized in hospital functions and of such a nature that it can be readily sterilized andmaintained in a sterile condition. 
 It is also an object to provide a coupling unit which is of molded plastic and thus inexpensive enough to permit expendability. Another object is the use of the inherent resiliency of the plastic to obtain the engagement and disengagement function. 
 Reference is made to United States patents to Mullenux, No. 1,284,332, dated July 12, 1921 and to Koenig, No. 1,203,630, dated Nov. 7, 1916-. l 
 It is also an object to provide a device which can be readily attached -to the end of tubes and a device which permits tubes to be easily and rapidly connected and disconnected in a tight liquid and airproof joint. 
 It is a further object to provide a union which is extremely compact with no outward projections and which visibly indicates a good connection at a glance, and which can be readily disconnected by l'a slight finger pressure easily applied by a nurse or assisting technician. 
Other objects and features of the invention relating to details of construction and operation will be apparent in the following specification directed to the manner of ICC making and using the devices and setting forth the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. j 
 Drawings accompany the disclosure and the various views thereof may be brieliy described as: 
 FIGURE 1, a sectional view longitudinally of the joint showing the respective parts in assembly. 
 FIGURE 2, an outside elevation of the device rotated 910 from the position shown'in FIGURE 1 to further illustrate the parts. 
 FIGURE 3, a detailed view of a preferred construction for interlock. 
vReferring to the drawings: 
 Two plastic or rubber tubes 10 and 12 coming from the left and right of the drawing are shown connected to the respective nipple ends 14 and 16 of telescoping connection devices 18 and 20. The -tubes 10 and 12 are preferably formed of a transparent plastic which will permit ready observation of fluid flow. The ends 14 and 16 are provided with annular grooves which create a saw tooth section so that the soft plastic will engage firmly. The outer telescoping union member 18 has an internal diameter 22 substantially equal to the inner diameter of the tube 12 and substantially equal to the internal diameter 24 of the section 20 of the joint. 
 The enlarged telescoping portion 18 has a cylindrical recess for receiving the end 26 of the element 20, this latter end having parallel grooves and suitable O-rings 28 contained therein for forming a tight air and fluid seal with the internal diameter of the element 18. Where the nipple portion 14 joins the element 18, there is a sharp annular shoulder 30 lwhich cooperates with two parallel arms 32 and 34 each of which has at a distal end a latch projection 36. These arms are mounted, in the embodi- -ment shown, on integral projections 40 and 44 and spaced from the outer surface 42 of element 20. The extension portions of the arms 34 can be designated 52 and 54. It is preferable that the arms 32, 34 and the projections 40, 44 be molded integrally with coupling element 20. 
 In the assembly shown in FIGURE 1, it will be seen that the coupling device is locked together by reason of the latch projections 36 being positioned behind the annular shoulder 30. It is possible, however, to move these latch projections 36 to a release position -by pressure applied at A and B against the portions 52 and 54 which are spaced from the outer diameter of the section 20. 
 This pressure causes the arms 32, 34 to yfulcrum at the projections 40 and lifts the latch projections 26 radially outward to clear the shoulder 30. In this position, the coupling' can be readily uncoupled by withdrawing the section 26 from the recess in section 18. 
 In assembly, the two elements of the coupling will move together without any special application of pressure since the angled ends 60 on the latch projections 36 will cam over the annular angled surface 62 at the end of the body 18. Thus, the joint may be rapidly pushed together and the portion 26 of the section 20 will move directly into its proper recess while the arms 32 flex sufficiently to allow the latch projections 36 to reach and fall in place behind the annular shoulder 30. 
 In FIGURE 3, there is detailed a preferred structure at the latching area showing an undercut shoulder angled inwardly to cooperate with inwardly angled latch projections 72. This construction cooperates with the projections 40 which limit the relative axial movement of the assembly in the engagement direction. The parts move l'together and seal as soon as the O-rings 28 are received engage the, parts will causethe projections 72 to cam.. 
into the re-entrant surface 70, drawing the arms 32, 34 inwardly. When disengagement is intended, however, the parts can be shifted to the full degree of engagement and latch projections 72 are then cleared from shoulder 70 to an easily releasable position as previously described. 
 There is thus described a quick coupling unit which is easily cleaned and can be autoclaved maintaining the necessary sterile conditions. The device can also be readily observed as engaged by a glance and can be quickly engaged or disengaged by the simple expedient of a pushon connection or a pull disconnection with pressure at points A and B. Thus, threaded joints and stainless steel metal structures can be completely avoided in the operating room. The device is also of sufficiently simple and inexpensive design and construction that the joints could be made to be expendable once they have functioned in a particular operative use. 
 In addition, the device is such that it locks into position when there is any tension applied to the joint which might tend to separate the parts. Also, the O-ring joint between the telescoping parts adds a friction component helping to control the engagement.

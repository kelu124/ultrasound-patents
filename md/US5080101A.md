No. 4,658,828, now Reissue No. 33,590 of May 21, 1991 which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 674,889, filed Nov. 26, 1984, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,617,931, now Re-Examination Certificate B1-4,617,931 of July 12, 1988.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Conventional echography apparatus are used for examining tumors inside the body by forming an image thereof on the screen of a cathode ray tube.
As is known, it is also possible to obtain destruction of the cells--particularly malignant cells--by subjecting them to extended temperature rise. The cells to be destroyed must, for example, be brought to about 45 degrees C. in a well controlled way while avoiding reaching excessive temperatures which could cause serious burns around the lesion. One of the technical problems to be resolved for hyperthermia and other treatment applications consists both in controlling the amount of energy and the localization thereof.
With different prior art processes (use of ultrahigh frequencies, infrared radiation and others) superficial tumors can be treated but deeper tissues cannot be reached.
The invention proposes applying ultrasound to examination processes used in hyperthermia and other treatment and provides a method and apparatus which combines the three functions of localizing the zone to be treated, of treating in a well controlled way in a well defined restricted region within this zone and simultaneously checking the results of the treatment during treatment.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The method and apparatus of the invention can be used for hyperthermia and other kinds of treatment. The method and apparatus of the invention combines a generator exciting a pulsed focused treatment beam comprising a main high frequency wave emitter and a main transducer, with a separate echography device comprising an auxiliary high frequency pulse generator associated with an auxiliary piezoelectric transducer and with means for causing the zone to be treated to be swept during treatment by the ultrasonic examination beam generated by the auxiliary transducer. The invention includes switching and adjusting means for causing, during main power treatment and checking operations, the pulsed emission of a treatment sequence of vibration discharges as a focused beam by the main transducer, energized by the main emitter, during periodic time intervals.
The invention advantageously comprises a first auxiliary locating operation mode during which the emission of the examination beam as scanning pulses by the auxiliary transducer is effected; and preferably a second auxiliary operating mode for checking the focal region, during which only the periodic emission of the treatment beam is effected. The main emitter preferably is synchronized by the synchronization circuit of the auxiliary generator for echographic operation for hyperthermia treatment, the time intervals which separate the successive emission periods during the two auxiliary operating modes being substantially smaller then the intervals which separate the periods of emission of the focused beam during the treatment mode.
During the auxiliary operating modes for obtaining accurate adjustments, the quality of the echographic image, either of the zone located within a body to be treated (locating mode) or of the focal region (mode for checking the restricted region), will be substantially better than during the treatment mode, during which the successive images of the zone to be treated in the case of hyperthermia treatment will follow each other for example at intervals of the order of a second, which however allows the position of the focal region to be checked satisfactorily during treatment.
In a preferred embodiment, the auxiliary transducer is connected to the main transducer which comprises a concave focusing surface and thus, during movement of the treatment transducer to bring the focal spot into successive restricted regions of the zone, the auxiliary transducer will at all times supply an image of the treated region and of the zone which surrounds it, thus allowing a continuous check of the treatment zone to be effected easily and accurately.

Other features and advantages of the invention will be clear from the following description.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
In FIG. 2 is shown a main treatment transducer 1 in the form of a spherical skull cap supported by a mount which allows it to move, in any order, along three orthogonal axes X, Y and Z. This mount has been shown schematically, its construction being within the scope of a man skilled in the art. Generally along or in the direction of any axis of the spherical skull cap there is disposed an auxiliary transducer 2 of a generally cylindrical shape which preferably passes through skull cap 1 and is connected thereto. A pocket of water P is placed between the skull cap 1 and a patient so that the pocket wall contacts the surface S of the body of the patient, who is assumed to be lying flat on a horizontal plane to provide an acoustic coupling through a portion of the body.
The skull cap 1 has for example a diameter of 200 to 300 mm and when it is an active surface is formed from a large number (300 or 400) of piezoelectric elements 10, 11, etc. . . . (FIG. 1) isolated from each other and juxtaposed to form a mosaic. The elements are metallized on both faces, one of the metallizations being connected to ground and the other to connections for energization by a main emitter 3 (FIG. 1).
Emitter 3 delivers an interrupted electric signal to form high frequency waves (500 KHz for example) in a treatment sequence as pulsed vibration discharges separated by interruption time intervals of the order of 1/10 second, the time required for the echography device to form an image. Operating conditions may be obtained by means of emitters using power transistors.
Preferably, the elements of transducer 1 will be divided up into groups each energized by a separate emitter (rectangle 3 symbolizing the assembly of these emitters), the elements of each group being spaced apart in the same circular zone of the spherical surface. By adjusting the relative phases of the emissions, it is possible to modify the energy distribution in the focusing region of the treatment beam.
An input 31 to emitter 3 symbolizes means for adjustment of the emitted power and an input 32 symbolizes means for adjustment of the pulse shape or treatment wave duration. The focal spot formed in the center F of the sphere may, with this technique, be very small (diameter of 2 or 3 mm for example) and have a position which is strictly fixed for a given position of the transducer.
In FIG. 1 it can be seen that the auxiliary transducer 2, which may comprise an active surface, is itself connected both to a separate high frequency electric pulse emitter 21 and to a reception amplifier 22 followed by an analog-digital converter 23, itself followed by a memory 24. Emitter 21 can be connected to and synchronized by a pulse generator 211 which delivers a sequence of 256 pulses during each of the successive time intervals of 1/10 second. An acoustic signal beam is radiated and swept across the zone. Each of these time intervals corresponds a complete sweep of a given angular sector theta (FIG. 1) by the beam emitted by transducer 2.
Transducer 2 is advantageously of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,698, granted on Dec. 31, 1983, comprising an oscillating piezoelectric element 200 controlled by a motor 201, itself controlled by an electronic circuit which is shown symbolically by a rectangle 4. This circuit provides control signals for the motor 201 housed inside the case of the transducer 2 and is adapted so that a complete oscillation of the motor corresponds to the above defined duration for forming an image (1/10 second).
In a first operating mode (treatment and checking) switch 210 is in a position I as well as switches 212 and 33. In position I of switches 33 and 212, generator 211 is synchronized by a first output 41 of circuit 4, which is adjusted, by means not shown, for generating signals at its output 43 connected to motor 201. An image is then swept through the water pocket in 1/10 second in which the echoes are converted to displayed electric signals and is followed by a time interval of one second during which transducer 2 receives no echoes.
During intervals between the sweep periods, a circuit 34 generates square waves of one second which synchronize emitter 3, whereas, during the sweep periods, a circuit 213 generates square waves of 1/10 second which synchronize the generator 211.
Thus, in this operating mode, transducer 1 generates an interrupted treatment beam under substantially continuous operating conditions as a treatment sequence whereas the echography device forms an image every second in the interruptions or intervals between the waves. The wave forms of the signals emitted by generator 211 are shown at Bt.
In a second operating mode (locating) with switch 210 in position I, switch 33 is in position II, so that emitter 3 is not synchronized and the focused ultrasonic treatment beam is not emitted. Switch 212 is also in position II so that generator 211 is synchronized by a second output 42 of circuit 4 which is adjusted to generate signals at its output 43. The 1/10 second echography sweeps are separated by intervals of only 1/100 second and the images are formed from echoes converted to electric signals coming from reflection of the pulses generated by transducer 2. Generator 211 delivers the signals.
In a third operating mode (checking the focal region), switch 210 is in position III, so that the emitter 21 and transducer 2 do not emit. Switch 212 is again in position II so that generator 211 is synchronized by the output 42 of circuit 4 which is adjusted as in the second operating mode so that the 1/10 second sweeps are again separated by intervals of 1/100 second. Switch 33 is in position III and consequently emitter 3 is synchronized by the generator 211 which then delivers the signals. In this third operating mode, the echographic device is therefore formed by emitter 3, transducer 1 operating for emission and transducer 2 operating for reception. The result is that an image of the distribution of the concentration of energy in the focal region emitted by the transducer 1 is obtained.
The echographic signals from the reflected surfaces in the treated zone received at 22 in the first or third operating modes are, after analog-digital conversion at 23, stored line by line in memory 24, a writing addressing device 25, controlled by circuit 4, causing the respective deflection angles of the beam emitted and/or received by transducer 2 to correspond with the respective lines of the memory. A device 26 for rapid reading of the memory energizes the X and Y deflection coils of a cathode ray tube 28, so the brightness control electrode receives the corresponding contents from memory 24, transformed into an analog signal by a digital-analog converter 27. The electrical signals are then displayed as an image of the anomaly in the zone.
The practical construction of all the circuits described and shown is within the scope of a man skilled in the art. The control circuit 4 may for example comprise a one shot multivibrator delivering square waves of a duration adjustable to 1/100 second or one second depending on the operating mode and circuits for generating increasing and decreasing voltages of a 1/10 second duration, triggered by said square waves.
The apparatus and method which has just been described operates as follows:
In the locating operating mode, the operator searches for and localizes the zone to be treated and/or altered. The display device is adapted, in a way known per se, so as to materialize a cursor mark on the screen of a cathode ray tube (for example by a cross) indicating the theoretical position of the focal spot in the sectional plane shown, which plane passes through the axis of symmetry of transducer 1. The mark and zone are then maintained in coincidence. (It is a matter of B type echography). The operator begins aiming by moving transducer 1 in any order, for example first along axis X, until the treatment zone appears clearly on the screen, then he moves it along axes Y and Z, until the cursor cross mark coincides with the central region of the image of the zone (K, FIG. 3). At this moment, the switches may be placed in position for checking the focal region: only this latter is then visible on the screen, with a luminosity proportional to the corresponding distribution of energy concentration. Thus a representation is obtained of what the distribution of the energy of the treatment wave will be during treatment, which allows the adjustments to be checked and perfected.
During treatment, the apparatus and method supplies only one image per second, but this rate is sufficient for substantially continuously checking the position of the focal spot.
It is clear that the method described allows the evolution of the treatment to be checked both during and after each treatment sequence. It is evident that different modifications may be made thereto and even according to other embodiments, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

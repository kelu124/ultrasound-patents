A transducer drover alternately drives the transducer elements during one rotation of the transducer. A switching circuit alternately switches the echo signals from the transducer elements during one rotation of the transducer. The echo signals of the transducer elements through the switch circuit are signal-processed and supplied to a TV monitor to display a tomographic image.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a mechanical scanning type ultrasonic imaging apparatus and, more particularly, to an ultrasonic imaging apparatus which offers high scanning speed, improved transmission/reception S/N ratio, and improved resolution of a tomographic image.
Mechanical scanning type ultrasonic imaging apparatuses are widely used in the examination of living bodies. An endoscope/ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus combines such an ultrasonic imaging apparatus with an endoscope so as to perform diagnosis of an object to be examined. In such an endoscope/ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, an ultrasonic transducer is rotatably mounted at the distal end of an endoscope and is driven through a drive shaft by a motor mounted at operation section of the endoscope. The endoscope scanning section has an angle sensor for detecting scanning angle. An ultrasonic wave reflected from an object, i.e., an echo, is converted into an electric echo signal by the ultrasonic transducer. The echo signal from the ultrasonic transducer is amplified by a preamplifier and output to an external lead through a mechanical contact, e.g., a brush. The echo signal at the lead is supplied to a display device and displayed as a tomographic image of the object. In order to increase tomographic image resolution, the frequency of a drive pulse can be increased. However, ultrasonic waves in the object attenuate in proportion to the square of the frequency. Detection sensitivity deteriorates abruptly upon such attenuation. In order to compensate for such sensitivity deterioration, the drive pulse is processed, e.g., pulse-compressed, to increase its level.
In the conventional ultrasonic imaging apparatus described above, a flexible shaft is used as a power transmission member for transmitting power to the transducer. When the transducer is driven at high speed, mechanical resonation occurs due to the mass of the transducer and the elasticity of the flexible shaft. Then, the transducer cannot be driven at a constant speed and irregularities occur during each rotation. Such irregular rotation results in flare or fogging, and thus poor image quality, in the resultant tomographic image. In order to prevent this, conventionally, the transducer is driven at low speed. However, the scanning speed drops at low transducer speeds, and an image of high quality cannot be easily obtained for objects with rapid movements such as a man's heart. In order to prevent the above-mentioned mechanical resonation, the rigidity of the flexible shaft can be increased. However, when a flexible shaft having a relatively high rigidity is used, the diameter of the endoscope insertion section is increased, and flexibility of the endoscope is impaired.
In a conventional ultrasonic imaging apparatus, the echo signal from the transducer is supplied to the display device through the brush as described above. Therefore, when the rotating speed of the transducer is increased, the brush vibrates, chattering increases, and the S/N ratio is lowered.
In order to increase resolution, the transmission output, i.e., the drive pulse, is increased in level by pulse compression. More heat is generated by the transducer because of its low conversion efficiency. The transducer can then be easily degraded and has a short life.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to provide an endoscope/ultrasonic imaging apparatus which allows high speed scanning without causing flare or fogging of an image, which can obtain an excellent tomographic image of a rapidly moving object, which can provide an echo signal with high S/N ratio, and which can provide an object image with high resolution.
According to the present invention, two transducers are rotatably arranged back to back at the endoscope distal end with a damper medium interposed therebetween. The two transducer elements are switched upon each half rotation thereof for transmission/reception. A received signal or echo signal is supplied to a display device through a rotary transformer. The transducer elements are cooled by a circulating liquid filling a transducer housing and serving as an ultrasonic wave propagation medium.

FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a transducer; and
FIG. 3 is a perspective view of another transducer.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
As seen in FIG. 1A, an endoscope comprises an operation section A, insertion section B extending from section A, and distal portion C at the distal end of section B.
Servo motor 1 is arranged in section A. Rotation of motor 1 is transmitted to rotary unit 3 by timing belt 2. Unit 3 is rotatably supported in section A by bearings 4 and 5. Motor 1, timing belt 2, and rotary unit 3 constitute a rotary driving unit.
One end of unit 3 is coupled to hollow flexible shaft 6. Shaft 6 is rotatably inserted into section B. The distal end of shaft 6 extends into transducer housing 7C of portion C and is coupled to transducer rotor 7. Rotor 7 is rotatably housed in housing 7C and includes two transducer elements 11 and 12 fixed back to back with damper medium 10 interposed therebetween and formed of material absorbing ultrasonic waves. Elements 11 and 12 may be circular or square in shape as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. When elements 11 and 12 are square, the opening area becomes 1.3 times that when elements 11 and 12 are circular, and the sensitivity and directivity of elements 11 and 12 are improved. Silicone convex lenses 15 and 16 are adhered to elements 11 and 12 through acoustic multi-layers 13 and 14 formed of material transmitting ultrasonic waves. Elements 11 and 12 are coupled to one end of each of signal cables 21 and 22 extending through shaft 6. Cables 21 and 22 extend into rotary unit 3 of section A.
A means for alternately outputting two sequences of drive signals for each half rotation of elements 11 and 12 is arranged in signal transmission/reception device D. The means has a photo-reflector 24 arranged to oppose mirror 23 mounted on an end face of unit 3. Photo-reflector 24 generates one sync pulse upon each half rotation of unit 3. When a sync pulse from photo-reflector 24 is supplied to gate signal generator 25 of control section D, generator 25 generates a gate pulse in synchronism with the received sync pulse. The gate pulse alternately switches switch 26. Therefore, a transmission trigger signal from control circuit (timing signal generator) 27 is alternately supplied to transmission circuits 31 and 32 through switch 26. Circuits 31 and 32 are alternately driven upon each half rotation of elements 11 and 12 and alternately supply two sequences of ultrasonic transmission signals to elements 11 and 12. A transmission signal from circuit 31 is supplied to unit 3 through rotary contact 33 in section A and then to element 11 through diode circuit 41 and signal cable 21. Similarly, a transmission signal from circuit 32 is supplied to element 12 through rotary contact 34, diode circuit 42, and signal cable 22. In this manner, elements 11 and 12 are energized upon each half rotation thereof.
An echo from an object is converted into echo signals by elements 11 and 12. The two sequences of echo signals are supplied to switch 46 through signal cables 21 and 22 and output from switch 46 as one echo signal sequence. More specifically, photo-reflector 44 mounted to oppose mirror 43 near an end face of unit 3 generates a pulse upon each half rotation of elements 11 and 12 in response to a signal output from photo-reflector 24. When the pulse from photo-reflector 44 is supplied to gate signal generator 45 of unit 3, generator 45 outputs a gate signal synchronous with the received pulse. Switch 46 alternately switches cables 21 and 22 in synchronism with the gate signal. Therefore, two echo signal sequences are alternately supplied to preamplifier 47 and output as one echo signal sequence from preamplifier 47.
The echo signal from preamplifier 47 is output to an external circuit from unit 3 through rotary transformer 48. The echo signal supplied to primary winding 48a of transformer 48 is transmitted to secondary winding 48b by electromagnetic induction. The echo signal from winding 48b is supplied to amplifier 51 of control section D. The echo signal from amplifier 51 is processed by signal processor 52 and supplied to digital scan converter 53. Converter 53 converts the input echo signal into a television signal and supplies it to TV monitor 54. TV monitor 54 thus displays a tomographic image.
Rotary unit 3 has diode circuit 61 for isolating the earth terminals of circuits 31 and 32 and preamplifier 47 from small signals. Diode circuit 61 thus serves to prevent introduction of contact noise and noise from the earth terminals. Unit 3 further has filter 62 for high-frequency separation of the power source and power source return power line in order to eliminate contact noise and power source noise.
Ultrasonic transmissive liquid 70 filling transducer housing 7C is circulated to remove heat generated by elements 11 and 12. For this purpose, motor 1 is coupled to circulation pump 72 (e.g., a peristaltic pump) through timing belt 2, drive shaft 6, and timing belt 71. The inlet and outlet ports of pump 72 communicate with housing 7C through radiator 73 and circulation paths 74 and 75 so as to allow circulation of liquid 70. Drive shaft 6 is shielded from liquid 70 by shielding member 76.
With the above apparatus, two transducer elements 11 and 12 are arranged back to back with damper medium 10 interposed therebetween. Elements 11 and 12 are rotated at the distal portion of section B and switched upon each half rotation thereof for reception of an echo. Therefore, even if the rotating speed of elements remains the same as in conventional apparatuses, the scanning speed is doubled.
Rotary transformer 48 extracts an echo signal outside unit 3. Therefore, even if the elements are driven at high speed, chattering noise such as is found in a conventional apparatus is not mixed in. Since the earth side of the signal in section A can be kept in the floating state, noise generated by motor 1 and the like is not mixed in. Since the liquid (water) used as an ultrasonic transmissive medium is circulated and cooled to cool elements 11 and 12, elements 11 and 12 can be driven by a high drive pulse obtained by pulse compression and can produce a high ultrasonic output. With such a high ultrasonic output, a tomographic image of high resolution can be obtained.
In the above embodiment, since the rotation angle is detected by two photo-reflectors 24 and 44, the number of rotary contacts in unit 3 can be reduced. In addition, since diode circuits 41 and 42 are provided, noise from circuits 31 and 32 and chattering noise can be prevented in the reception mode.
Diode circuit 61 and filter 62 serve to eliminate contact noise, earth noise, and power source noise.
In this manner, since the transmission output is high and noise is reduced, an object image does not contain flares or fog and an object under examination can be scanned at high speed. An image of a rapidly moving object such as a man's heart can therefore be obtained with high resolution and S/N ratio.

INT CL 3 H 03 L 7/18 ( 52) Index at acceptance H 3 A L 2 D 2 LX P QA ( 72) Inventors ROGER EDWIN JOHN GERARD and BOLESLAW MARIAN SOSIN ( 54) FREQUENCY GENERATORS ( 71) We, THE MARCONI COMPANY LIMITED, a British Company, of Marconi House, New Street, Chelmsford, Essex C Ml l PL, do hereby declare the invention, for which we pray that a patent may be granted to us, and the method by which it is to be performed, to be particularly described in and by the following statement: This invention relates to frequency generators and seeks to provide, in an economical manner, a generator in which one of a number of predetermined frequency values can be readily selected. 
According to this invention, a frequency generator includes a variable frequency output oscillator; a comparator arranged to receive, via a first variable frequency divider, a first signal derived from the output oscillator; the comparator also being arranged to receive via a second variable frequency divider a second signal derived from a reference oscillator, the frequency of said output oscillator being controlled by a signal derived from the comparator in dependence on said first and second signals; means for storing a plurality of selected predetermined divisor values and means for setting said first and second variable frequency dividers in accordance with selected divisor values. 
Preferably, said comparator is a combined frequency and phase comparator connected in a phase lock loop so as to adjust the frequency of the output oscillator until the phases of the first and second signals are in agreement Preferably again, a control circuit is provided and which is arranged to select predetermined pairs of divisor values from a store to set the divisor values of the first and second dividers respectively. 
Preferably, a low pass filter is provided between the output of the comparator and the output oscillator. 
In contrast with conventional phase locked loop systems, although the output frequency is directly locked to a reference frequency, the resultant frequency produced in general is not an integral number of Hz, and may in some cases have a frequency error of several Hz relative to the desired value In instances where a small error is acceptable, this system provides a cost effective solution. 
Long term accuracy is dependent on the reference oscillator. 
Only predetermined output frequency values can be obtained in dependence on the value of the reference frequency, since the divisor provided by each divider is an integer It is, therefore, preferable to provide means for modifying the reference frequency by a small offset value to allow output frequencies to be provided which could not otherwise be obtained by selection of particular divisor values. 
One or more offset frequencies may be used. 
The invention is further described, by way of example, with reference to the drawing accompanying the Provisional specification which illustrates in diagrammatic form a frequency generator in accordance with the present invention. 
Referring to the drawing, there is provided a reference oscillator 1, the output of which is passed to a phase comparator 2 via a variable frequency divider 3 The phase comparator also receives a signal provided by a variable output oscillator 4 via a further variable frequency divider 5 The phase comparator 2 provides an output signal which is fed via a low pass filter 9 to control the frequency of the variable oscillator 4 so as to modify its frequency value until the two signals received by the phase comparator are in exact agreement Exact agreement is achieved only when both signals have the same frequency and phase relationship The divisor values of the variable frequency dividers 3 and 5 are determined by a control circuit 6 by means of which appropriate pairs of divisor values can be selected from a store 7. 
Typically, the control circuit 6 could comprise a small keyboard under the manual control of an operator The keyboard would have a relatively small number of individual push buttons, possibly not more than ten, arranged such that depression of a particular push button selects a pair of divisor values from the store 7 in accordance with a desired value of output frequency The use of ten QZ of ( 11) 1 564 375 (. 
1,564,375 push buttons allows ten seperate frequencies to be selected, the values of which are predetermined by the twenty divisor values held in the store 7. 
The values of divisors forming the ratio N/M which gave acceptably small frequency errors to the wanted frequency would be computed externally, prior to being written in the store Any known form of store per se could be employed, electrical or mechanical. 
Conveniently, it could comprises a read-only memory. 
If M and N are respectively the divisor values of the variable frequency dividers 3 and 5, the output frequency F 2 provided by the variable frequency oscillator 4 is given by: 
N F 2 =-x F 1, M where F 1 is the frequency of the reference oscillator 1. 
Depending on the selected values of M and N, the value of F 2 is not necessarily an integral number of cycles per second, but in general will be fractional Thus, it may not be possible to exactly obtain a required frequency, but by careful choice of Fl, M and N, the difference frequency, or error, can be made acceptably small for many applications This point is further explained in connection with the following table in which Fl = 70 M Hz and an output frequency of 98.123456 M Hz is required Restricting the values of M and N to the range of 3,500 to 10,000 the following ratios give reasonably small errors. 
M 4423 3629 6464 5670 4876 6917 N 6200 5087 9061 7948 6835 9696 F out (Hz) 98,123,445 63 98,123,449 97 98,123,452 98 98,123,456 76 98,123,461 87 98,123,463 90 Error (Hz) -1037 -6.03 -3.02 + 0.76 + 5.87 + 7.90 From the table it will be seen that the smallest error is obtained for values of M= 5670 and N= 7948 It is clear that a very large number of possible combinations of M and N exist, and that a very large store 7 would be required to hold all possible pairs of values or even a large proportion of them In practice, however, the frequency generator is intended to be used where a relatively small number of predetermined frequency values are required very rapidly on selection, at low cost Accordingly, typically only ten values need be stored in the store 7, as already mentioned, and these ten values can be very readily accessed by a simple control circuit 6 It will, thus, be seen that a number of predetermined frequencies can be provided in a relatively simple and economical way By choosing the value of M so as to apply a relatively high frequency to the phase comparator 2, a rapid response time of the phase lock loop can be achieved A rapid response time can be a very important consideration for certain applications For example, the present invention is particularly suitable for use with broadcast transmitters. 
For such an application, only a relatively few number of broadcast frequencies will be required and the values of F 1 and the stored divisor values M and N can be chosen with the possible broadcast carrier frequencies in mind. 
When the frequency error in the system, as described above, is larger than can be tolerated for specific applications, the frequency generator can be modified as shown in broken line on the drawing A further store 11 and a subtractor 12 are used to modify the value of the reference frequency F 1 by an amount, typically about 100 Hz, which is large compared to the tolerated error and hence readily achievable Conveniently, the subtractor 12 is a known form of digital subtractor, but the offset reference frequency can be achieved in other known ways, for example, by using an analogue mixer or a subtracting phase lock loop In this case, the store 11 (which could be merely a particular location in the existing store 7) holds data relating to the one or more required frequency offset values, and is addressed as necessary by the control circuit 6 in dependence on the selected value of the output frequency F 2. 
By suitable choice of an offset frequency, it is possible to obtain a selectable range of output frequencies in which the size of gaps' between adjacent frequency values achievable is much reduced as compared with the unmodified frequency generator.

## Abstract

Abstract

Acoustic imaging catheters formed by a disposable liquid-confining sheath supporting a high fidelity, flexible drive shaft which carries on its end an ultrasound transducer. The shaft and transducer rotate with sufficient speed and fidelity to produce real time images on a T.V. screen. Special features that contribute to the high fidelity of the drive shaft include the particular multifilar construction of concentric, oppositely wound, interfering coils, a preloaded torque condition on the coils enhancing their interfering contact, and dynamic loading of the distal end of the probe, preferrably with viscous drag. The coil rotating in the presence of liquid in the sheath is used to produce a desirable pressure in the region of the transducer. Numerous selectable catheter sheaths are shown including a sheath with an integral acoustically-transparent window, sheaths with end extensions that aid in positioning, a liquid injection-producing sheath, a sheath having its window section under tension employing an axially loaded bearing, a sheath carrying a dilatation or positioning balloon over the transducer, a sheath carrying a distal rotating surgical tool and a sheath used in conjunction with a side-viewing trocar.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to acoustic imaging catheters employing a rotating transducer.
It has long been recognized that acoustic imaging by use of internal probes has potential use in visualizing conditions of a body.
For example, Brown et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,949,910, describes a catheter within a heart which detects heart size by a fixed transducer which emits sound waves and detects the echo return; Bom, U.S. Pat. No. 3,938,502, describes an ultrasonic device to be placed within a heart, comprising a catheter of 3 mm outer diameter having a plurality of fixed transducers. Peronneau, U.S. Pat. No. 3,542,014, describes a catheter having a piezoelectric transducer for measuring the size of a blood vessel; Frazer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,662, describes an endoscope employing a transmitter of ultrasonic energy waves so that its position within a body can be determined; Green et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,327,738, describe an endoscope, having a transducer which is inserted into a body cavity such the stomach; Trimmer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,006, and Leeny et al., UKA 2,175,828, describe solid needles, for detecting sound waves, which may be inserted within a body; Silverstein et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,462,408, describe an endoscope having an array of ultrasonic transducers which can be inserted into a body cavity such, as the stomach; and Pourcelot et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,009, describe an endoscopic probe suitable for studying coronary arteries. Other internal probes have been proposed which cause movement of the ultrasonic beam to produce images of body features, of which the following are examples.
Eggleton et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,779,234, describes an ultrasonic catheter for placement through an esophagus or chest wall. The catheter rotates at 360 rpm and has four transducers each having a diameter of 5 mm. The transducers are focused horizontally with an effective depth of penetration of about 15 cm. The housing of the catheter rotates and "may be a flexible stainless steel shaft constructed of right and left helices to maximize the torsional stiffness of the rotating assembly with the stationary housing. [such as produced by S. S. White and Company]".
Baba, U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,525, describes an ultrasonic device which may be placed within a body cavity and against a body wall. The transducers are rotated at between 500-900 rpm. The inserted section is generally rigid, but flexible enough to be placed against a body wall.
Suwaki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,375,818, describe an endoscope having an ultrasonic transducer suitable for positioning within a celiac cavity. The transducer can be rocked by a drive motor adjacent to it.
Ando et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,282, describe an ultrasonic apparatus for celiac cavity insertion, for examination of the heart and pancreas. "[A] flexible power transmission member such as a coil wire or the like . . . " is provided.
Nakada et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,558,706, describe an ultrasonic and optical device. The ultrasonic pulse is rotated by a mirror held on a "soft shaft formed of two inside and outside wound layer coils. These inside and outside coils are wound reversely to each other so that the outside diameter will not vary with the rotating direction and the rotation will be able to be effectively transmitted when curved." Gas bubbles generated within the catheter are removed through a conduit passing from the housing chamber to an outside chamber.
Kondo et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,201, describe an intraluminal ultrasonic scanner which can be inserted into the stomach or pancreas The transducer is secured to a rotary shaft connected to a flexible shaft.
Andou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,674,515, describe an ultrasonic endoscope suitable for placement in a body cavity.
DE 3,619,195, appears to describe an ultrasonic catheter with a coil-spring driven magnet, which, by magnetic coupling, in turn causes rotation of a transducer.
Others previously have suggested employing miniature ultrasonic catheters to sense the wall thickness of blood vessels from within the vessel. Such suggestions have included rotatable catheters and sensing the rotation to provide so-called B-mode images of wall thickness.
Wider effective use of acoustic imaging would occur, especially in the vascular system, if such a system could be considerably smaller, have good image fidelity, and be simple, inexpensive and dependable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
According to one aspect of the invention, an elongated, flexible ultrasonic probe of the type comprising a coil-form drive shaft and an acoustic transducer carried on the distal end of the drive shaft, is provided wherein, (a) the drive shaft comprises at least a pair of inner and outer, concentric, oppositely and closely wound, hollow, multifilar coils, (b) each coil has a ratio of outer radius of coil to thickness of coil filament in the radial direction of between about 21/2 and 10, (c) the coils are joined together at their respective ends with interfering contact with each other along their mutual length, and (d) the filaments of each coil have a pitch angle of about 20° or greater, so that when drive torque is applied to the drive shaft from the proximal end in the direction tending to reduce the diameter and lengthen the outer coil and increase the diameter and shorten the inner coil, a substantial component of the resultant stress on each filament of the coils is aligned with the axis of the filament, whereby substantial mechanical fidelity of angular displacement between the transducer and the proximal end of the drive shaft is maintained during rotation of the drive shaft.
According to another aspect of the invention an acoustic catheter is provided comprising an elongated, flexible, liquid-confining catheter sheath and an elongated, flexible ultrasonic probe disposed within and rotatably supported by a lumen of the sheath, the ultrasonic probe comprising a transducer supported on the end of an elongated coil-form drive shaft, the exterior of the drive shaft being supported by the internal surface of the catheter lumen, the inner diameter of the lumen being no more than about 1/4 mm greater than the outer diameter of the drive shaft along most of their mutual length and being no more than about 1/10 mm greater than the outer diameter of the drive shaft in the distal region of the drive shaft and the transducer, a distal portion of the catheter sheath that corresponds with the position of the transducer being substantially transparent to acoustical energy trasmitted and received by the transducer and the probe and the sheath being cooperatively constructed and arranged to enable removal and replacement of the sheath in a disposable manner.
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a catheter sheath, per se, adapted to receive and rotatably support a predetermined elongated ultrasonic probe of the type comprising a coil-form rotatable drive shaft of predetermined length and an acoustic transducer carried on the distal end of the drive shaft, the path of rotation of the transducer having a diameter no greater than the drive shaft, the catheter sheath comprising a closed-end, elongated, flexible liquid-confining, resinous, flexible member having a lumen for receiving the probe, a distal portion of the sheath corresponding to the position of the rotatable transducer when inserted in the lumen being substantially transparent to acoustical energy transmitted and received by the transducer, the internal surface of the lumen sized to rotatably support the drive shaft.

General Structure
Referring to FIG. 1, a micro acoustic imaging catheter 6 according to the invention is driven and monitored by a control system 8. The catheter is comprised of a disposable catheter sheath 12 (FIGS. 2 and 4) having a sound-transparent distal window 24 provided by dome element 25, in which is disposed a miniature, rotatable ultrasonic transducer 10 (FIGS. 3 and 4) driven by a special, high fidelity flexible drive shaft 18. A relatively rigid connector 11 is joined to the proximal end of the main body of the catheter sheath, adapted to be joined to a mating connector of drive and control system 8.
The catheter is adapted to be positioned in the body by standard catheter procedures for example within a blood vessel or the heart by guiding the flexible catheter through various blood vessels along a circuitous path, starting, for example, by percutaneous introduction through an introducer sheath 13 disposed in a perforation of the femoral artery 15.
Referring to FIG. 2, disposable catheter sheath 12 is a long tube, extruded from standard catheter materials, here nylon, e.g. with outer diameter, D, of 2 mm, wall thickness of 0.25 mm and length of 1 meter. Dome element 24, connected to the distal end of the tube, is a semi-spherically-ended cylindrical transducer cover constructed of material which is transparent to sound waves, here high impact polystyrene. This dome element has a thickness of approximately 0.125 mm and a length E of about 8 mm. For purposes described later herein, catheter sheath 12 in its distal region preferably tapers down over region R as shown in FIG. 4 to a narrowed diameter D' at its distal end, achieved by controlled heating and drawing of this portion of the original tube from which the sheath is formed. Catheter sheath 12 and acoustically transparent dome element 24, are adhesively bonded together.
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the drive shaft assembly 18 is formed of a pair of closely wound multifilar coils 26, 28 wound in opposite helical directions. These coils are each formed of four circular cross-sectional wires, one of which, 30, is shown by shading. Coils 26, 28 are soldered together at both the distal and proximal ends of the assembly in interference contact, here under rotational prestress. By also providing a pitch angle of greater than about 20°, a substantial part of the stress applied to the wire filaments of the coil is compression or tension in the direction of the axis of the filaments, with attendant reduction of bending tendencies that can affect fidelity of movement. There is also provision to apply a torsional load to the distal end of the assembly to cause the drive shaft to operate in the torsionally stiff region of its torsional spring constant curve, achieved by viscous drag applied to the rotating assembly by liquid filling the narrowed distal end of the catheter sheath (FIG. 4). Such loading, together with initial tight association of the closely wound filaments in the concentric coils, provides the assembly with a particularly high torsional spring constant when twisted in a predetermined direction. Thus, despite its lateral flexibility, needed for negotiating tortuous passages, the assembly provides such a torsionally stiff and accurate drive shaft that rotary position information for the distal end can, with considerable accuracy, be derived from measurement at the proximal end of the drive shaft, enabling high quality real-time images to be produced. (Further description of the coils of the drive shaft and their condition of operation is provided below.)
Coaxial cable 32 within coils 26, 28 has low power loss and comprises an outer insulator layer 34, a braided shield 36, a second insulator layer 38, and a center conductor 40. Shield 36 and center conductor 40 are electrically connected by wires 42, 44 (FIG. 5) to piezoelectric crystal 46 and electrically conductive, acoustical backing 48 respectively, of the transducer. Helical coils 26, 28, especially when covered with a highly conductive metal layer, act as an additional electric shield around cable 32.
Transducer crystal 46 is formed in known manner of one of a family of ceramic materials, such as barium titanates, lead zirconate titanates, lead metaniobates, and PVDFs, that is capable of transforming pressure distortions on its surface to electrical voltages and vice versa. Transducer assembly 10 is further provided with an acoustic lens 52. The radius of curvature B of lens surface 52 is greater than about 2.5 mm, chosen to provide focus over the range f (FIG. 6) between about 2 to 7 mm. The lens is positioned at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of the catheter so that, during rotation, it scans a conical surface from the transducing tip, the angle preferably being between 10° and 80°, e.g., 30°. Transducer backing 48 is acoustically matched to the transducer element to improve axial resolution.
The transducer assembly 10 is supported at the distal end of the drive shaft by a tubular sleeve 29 which is telescopically received over a distal extension of the inner coil 28, as shown in FIG. 3.
Referring again to FIG. 4, the length, E, of dome element 25 is sufficient to provide headroom F for longitudinal movement of transducer 10 within the dome element as catheter sheath 12 and coils 26, 28 are twisted along the blood vessels of the body. In the untwisted state, transducer 10 is a distance F, about 2 to 3 mm, from the internal end surface of the dome element 25. The dome element, along with catheter sheath 12 is adapted to be filled with lubricating and sound-transmitting fluid.
FIGS. 7-7b show the filling procedure used to prepare ultrasound catheter sheath 12 (or any of the other interchangeable sheaths, see FIGS. 13-26) for attachment to the ultrasound imaging driveshaft and transducer assembly. A sterile, flexible filling tube 17 attached to a syringe 19 is filled with sterile water. This filling catheter is inserted into the ultrasound catheter sheath 12, all the way to the distal tip. The water is then injected until it completely fills and the excess spills out of the ultrasound catheter while held in a vertical position, see FIG. 7a. This expels air from the catheter which could impair good acoustic imaging Continued pressure on the plunger of the syringe causes the flexible tube 17 to be pushed upward, out of catheter 12, FIG. 7b, leaving no air gaps behind. This eliminates the necessity to carefully withdraw the flexible filling tube at a controlled rate which could be subject to error. A holding bracket 21 is used to hold the catheter vertical during this procedure.
After the catheter sheath 12 is filled, the acoustic transducer 10 and shaft 18 are inserted, displacing water from the sheath 12, until the installed position, FIG. 7d, is achieved.
FIGS. 8 and 8a (and FIG. 1, diagrammatically) show the interconection arrangement for a connector 7 at proximal end of the acoustic catheter with connector 16 of the driving motor 20, and the path of the electric wires through the center shaft 43 of the driving motor. The center shaft and connector 16 rotate together, as do the wires that pass through the hollow motor shaft. The latter connect to a rotating electrical joint 25, which is held stationary at the back end and is connected to stationary coaxial cable 45 through a suitable connector such as a common BNC type. The enlarged view shows how the motor connector 16 and the driveshaft connector 7 mate when the two assemblies are pushed together, thereby making both electrical and mechanical contact. The catheter connector 7 is held in position by an ordinary ball bearing which provides a thrusting surface for the rotating connector 16 and driveshaft 18 while allowing free rotation. The disposable catheter sheath 12 includes an inexpensive, relatively rigid hollow bushing 11 of cylindrical construction that allows it to be slid into and held by means of a set screw in the housing that captures the non-disposable bearing, connector and driveshaft 18. Drive shaft coil assembly 18, thus attached at its proximal end to connector 16 of drive motor 20, rotates transducer 10 at speeds of about 1800 rpm. The transducer 10 is electrically connected by coaxial cable 32 extending through coil assembly 18 and via the cable through the motor to the proximal electronic components 22 which send, receive and interpret signals from the transducer. Components 22 include a cathode ray tube 23, electronic controls for the rotary repetition rate and standard ultrasonic imaging equipment, and see FIG. 12. A rotation detector, in the form of a shaft encoder shown diagrammatically at 19, detects the instantaneous rotational position of this proximal rotating assembly and applies that positional information to components 22, e.g., for use in producing the scan image.
By thus depending upon the position of proximal components to represent the instantaneous rotational position of the distal components, the rotational fidelity of the drive shaft is of great importance to this embodiment.
Manufacture and Assembly of the Drive Shaft
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, coils 26, 28 are each manufactured by winding four round cross-section stainless steel wires of size about 0.2 mm, so that Do is about 1.3 mm, Di is about 0.9 mm, do is about 0.9 mm and di is about 0.5 mm. The coils are closely wound with a pitch angle αo and αi where αo is smaller than αi, e.g., 22 1/2° and 31°, respectively. (Flat wires having a cross-sectional depth of about 0.1 mm may also be used.) The pitch angles are chosen to eliminate clearances 60 between the wires and to apply a substantial part of the stress in either tension or compression along the axis of the wire filaments. The coils, connected at their ends, are adapted to be turned in the direction tending to make outer coil 26 smaller in diameter, and inner coil 28 larger. Thus the two assemblies interfere with each other and the torsional stiffness constant in this rotational direction is significantly increased (by a factor of about 6) due to the interference. Operation of the driveshaft in the torsionally stiff region with enhanced fidelity is found to be obtainable by adding a torsional load to the distal end of the rotating assembly of the catheter. The importance of rotational fidelity and details of how it is achieved warrant further discussion.
For ultrasound imaging systems, the relative position of the ultrasound transducer must be accurately known at all times so that the return signal can be plotted properly on the display. Any inaccuracy in position information will contribute to image distortion and reduced image quality. Because, in the preferred embodiment, position information is not measured at the distal tip of the catheter, but rather from the drive shaft at the proximal end, only with a torsionally stiff and true drive shaft can accurate position information and display be obtained.
Furthermore, it is recognized that any drive shaft within a catheter sheath will have a particular angular position which is naturally preferred as a result of small asymmetries. Due to this favored position, the shaft tends, during a revolution, to store and then release rotational energy, causing non uniform rotational velocity. This phenomenon is referred to as "mechanical noise" and its effect is referred to as "resultant angular infidelity" for the balance of this explanation.
According to the present invention, use is made of the fact that suitably designed concentric coils interfere with each other, as has been mentioned previously. When twisted in one direction, the outer layer will tend to expand and the inner layer contract thus resulting in a torsional spring constant which is equal only to the sum of the spring constants of each of the two shafts. When, however, twisted in the opposite direction, the outer layer will tend to contract while the inner layer will expand. When interference occurs between the inner and outer layers the assembly will no longer allow the outer coil to contract or the inner to expand. At this point, the torsional spring constant is enhanced by the interference between the shafts and the torsional spring constant is found to become five or ten times greater than the spring constant in the "non-interference" mode.
Referring to FIG. 9, the relationship betweeen torque and angular deflection for such a coil assembly is shown, assuming one end fixed and torque applied at the opposite end. `Y` represents mechanical noise; `Z` resultant angular infidelity; `T` the interference point; the slope of the line `U`, the torsional spring constant (TSC) without interference (i.e., the sum of the torsional spring constant of each of the two coils); and the slope of the line `V`, the TSC with interference. Thus, TSC is shown to increase dramatically at the interference point.
Referring to FIG. 10, by pretwisting the shafts relative to one another and locking their ends together in a preloaded assembly, the interference point is moved to be close to the rest angle and resultant angular infidelity, Z, is reduced in the given direction of rotation.
To improve upon this effect even further, dynamic frictional drag is intentionally introduced at the distal end of the shaft to raise the level of torque being continually applied to the system. This ensures operation of the shaft in the region of the high torsional spring constant or "interference" mode throughout its length, producing a rotationally stiffer shaft. This is shown in FIG. 11, where `W` is dynamic load and `X` is the region of operation. The use of such dynamic drag is of particular importance in certain catheters of small diameter, e.g. with outer diameter less than about 2 mm.
To form inner coil 28, four individual wires are simultaneously wound around a mandrel of about 0.5 mm outer diameter. The free ends of this coil are fixed, and then four wires are wound in opposite hand directly over this coil to form the outer coil 26. The wires are wound under moderate tension, of about 22.5 gm/wire. After winding, the coils are released. The inner mandrel, which may be tapered or stepped, or have a constant cross-sectional diameter, is then removed. The wire ends are finished by grinding. One end is then soldered or epoxied to fix the coils together for a distance of less than 3 mm. This end is held in a rigid support and the coils are then twisted sufficiently, e.g. 1/4 turn, to cause the outer coil to compress and the inner coil to expand, causing the coils to interfere. The free ends are then also fixed.
The coil assembly 18 is generally formed from wires which provide a low spring index, that is, the radius of the outer coil 26 must be not more than about 2.5 to 10 times the diameter of the wires used in its construction. With a higher index, the inner coil may collapse. The multifilar nature of the coils enables a smaller diameter coil to be employed, which is of particular importance for vascular catheters and other catheters where small size is important.
After the coil assembly is completed, coaxial cable 32 is inserted within the inner coil. The cable may be silver-coated on braid 36 to enhance electrical transmission properties. It is also possible to use the inner and outer coils 26, 28 as one of the electrical conductors of this cable, e.g. by silver coating the coils.
Referring back to FIGS. 3 and 5, to form transducer 10, wire 42 is soldered to either side of electrically conducting sleeve 29 formed of stainless steel. Wire 44 is inserted into a sound absorbent backing 48 which is insulated from sleeve 29 by insulator 72. Piezoelectric element 46 of thickness about 0.1 mm is fixed to backing 48 by adhesive and electrical connection 74 is provided between its surface and the end of sleeve 29. Thus, wire 42 is electrically connected to the outer face of piezoelectric element 46, and wire 44 electrically connected to its inner face. Spherical lens 52, formed of acoustic lens materials is fixed to the outer surface of element 46.
Referring to FIGS. 4 and 7-7d, the completed drive shaft 18 and transducer 10 are inserted into disposable catheter sheath 12, positioning transducer 10 within acoustically transparent dome element 25, with liquid filling the internal open spaces. The catheter thus prepared is ready to be driven by the drive assembly, FIG. 8.
During use, rotation of drive shaft 18, due to exposure of the helical surface of the outer coil to the liquid, tends to create helical movement of the liquid toward the distal end of the sheath. This tends to create positive pressure in dome element 25 which reduces the tendency to form bubbles caused by outgassing from the various surfaces in this region.
As has been mentioned, it is beneficial to provide added drag friction at the distal end of the rotating drive shaft 18 to ensure operation in the torsionally stiff region of the torsional spring constant curve. It is found that this may be done by simply necking down the distal portion of the catheter sheath 12, as shown in FIG. 4 to provide a relatively tight clearance between the distal portion of the shaft 18 and the inner surface of the sheath, to impose the desired degree of viscous drag. As an alternative, the dynamic drag may be provided by an internal protrusion in catheter sheath 12 to create a slight internal friction against drive shaft 18.
A preferred acoustic catheter is constructed so that it may be preformed prior to use by standard methods. Thus, if the investigator wishes to pass the cathether through a known tortuous path, e.g., around the aortic arch, the catheter can be appropriately shaped prior to insertion. Such preformation can include bends of about 1 cm radius and still permit satisfactory operation of the drive shaft.
Electronics
FIG. 12 is a block diagram of the electronics of a basic analog ultrasound imaging system used with the acoustical catheter. The motor controller (D) positions the transducer B for the next scan line. The transmit pulser (A) drives the ultrasound transducer. The transducer (B) converts the electrical energy into acoustic energy and emits a sound wave. The sound wave reflects off various interfaces in the region of interest and a portion returns to the transducer. The transducer converts the acoustic energy back into electrical energy. The receiver (C) takes this waveform and gates out the transmit pulse. The remaining information is processed so that signal amplitude is converted to intensity and time from the transmit pulse is translated to distance. This brightness and distance information is fed into a vector generator/scan converter (E) which along with the position information from the motor controller converts the polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates for a standard raster monitor (F). This process is repeated many thousands of times per second.
By rotating the transducer at 1800 rpm, repeated sonic sweeps of the area around the transducer are made at repetition rate suitable for TV display, with plotting based upon the rotary positional information derived from the proximal end of the device. In this way a real time ultrasound image of a vessel or other structure can be observed.
We have found that within a blood vessel imaging system a focal point of between 1 and 7 mm is suitable and that a frequency of 15 to 40 MHz provides good resolution of vessel features in a practical manner.
Use
As mentioned above, the acoustical imaging catheter may be introduced by standard techniques, preferably by percutaneous insertion, into any desired blood vessel. Alternatively, it can be introduced directly into a body cavity or body tissue such as an organ. Due to its rotational fidelity, the device provides a relatively high quality, real time image of blood vessel tissue and allows ready diagnosis of disease states such as occlusion or dyskinesia. The acoustic properties of various tissues can also be discerned to allow more accurate diagnosis. It is also possible to form 3-dimensional images using appropriate computer software and by moving the catheter within the blood vessel. The device is also useful in angioplasty therapy to determine the nature and geometry of intravascular protrusions. This device may be combined with existing optical devices to provide a device having an ultrasonic visualizing probe and a laser ablating ability. The device may also be used in diagnosis of, e.g., esophageal tumors or prostate carcinomas, by passing the catheter through the anus, urethra, trachea, or esophagus. The catheter is also useful for valvuloplasty by insertion through a cardiac valve. Further, in non-medical areas, the device is useful for any inaccessible passages which are fluid filled, and thus transmit sound waves.
Selectable Catheter Sheaths
A wide variety of novel disposable catheter can be substituted for catheter sheath 12 and used in the system.
FIG. 13 shows a flexible, disposable catheter sheath 12a that is constructed like sheath 12 and has, in addition at its distal tip, a floppy guide wire 80 which is useful for guiding the ultrasound device through a valve such as of the heart. The guide wire is constructed of a closely wound wire coil 82 and an internal safety wire 84 for added strength. Wire 84 is welded to the distal tip of coil wire 82 and its proximal end is bent over within dome 24 and securely anchored with epoxy cement. In another embodiment, the safety wire extends through a separate lumen of the catheter sheath to a securing point at the proximal end of the catheter. In addition to its guiding function, coil 80, with suitable variation of length and stiffness, is useful in supporting and steadying the free end of the ultrasound device during axial movement of the catheter to improve its imaging capability, see e.g. FIGS. 25-25c.
FIG. 14 shows sheath 12b having needle 86 securely anchored to the tip, useful for impaling a surface, such as that found in the interior of the heart, and temporarily anchoring and steadying the ultrasound device in a fixed position. In another embodiment, it too can have a safety wire extending to a proximal securing point. This acoustic catheter may be introduced through an introducing catheter. In another embodiment, the needle can be retracted during introduction.
FIG. 15 shows another flexible, disposable sheath 12c that is constructed so that the sonoluscent (acoustically transparent) portion 24a is spaced from the distal end instead of at the end. The extension 12x beyond the window 24a may be of the same flexible catheter material as the main body of the sheath or of a different, e.g. softer material, and may be either open, so that fluids may pass through it, or closed, so that no fluids pass through. The distal extension of the catheter sheath can serve to stabilize the lateral position of the transducer during axial movement of the catheter during imaging.
FIG. 16 shows a catheter sheath 12d on which is mounted, over the transducer area, a dilatation balloon 55 such as is commonly used for angioplasty. The balloon is adapted to be pressurized with liquid, such as water, through the same lumen that holds the ultrasound imaging device, via an inflation opening in the wall of the catheter sheath. This catheter is used to open a clogged, stenotic or narrowed passage in the body, while simultaneously measuring the progress of the dilatation procedure with the ultrasound imager. Another embodiment with a suitable balloon may be used to center or position the ultrasound device securely within a body passage or cavity and maintain its position away from a feature of interest, for instance for imaging wall of the heart. The balloon in its collapsed or unpressurized state is easily inserted prior to positioning and may be accurately positioned by use of ultrasound imaging during initial placement. In other embodiments a separate lumen is provided for inflation of the balloon and/or the balloon is spaced from the distal end of the catheter.
FIG. 17 shows sheath 12e, similar to sheath 12, which is additionally fitted with an eyelet 90 through a solid portion of the tip to allow the free passage of a guide wire 92 which is used to help guide the catheter to a region of interest inside a passage of the body.
FIG. 18 shows sheath 12f having a two lumen construction. The large lumen contains the transducer and drive shaft while the small lumen contains a wire 94. As shown, wire 94 is a deflecting wire attached near the distal end, and is free to slide through its lumen under tension applied to ring 96 to cause the catheter to bend when pulled taut, thus providing a measure of control of the orientation of the distal end of the acoustic catheter while negotiating the passages of the body or the like. In another embodiment wire 94 may be a preformed stylette, which, when inserted through the second lumen, causes deflection of the tip.
FIG. 19 shows sheath 12g having a small hole 97 at its distal end to allow the passage of a fluid under pressure, such as saline or clot dissolving enzyme such as urokinase, or radiographic contrast enhancement fluids. By this device such fluids can be introduced under precise guidance using the ultrasound imaging capability of the catheter.
FIG. 20 shows sheath 12h placed in a specially designed hollow, rigid, sharply pointed metallic trocar 98 similar to a lance, designed to be driven into the body and further into the tissue of an organ of interest, such as the liver or spleen, to provide ultrasound imaging of an area where there is no natural passageway. A side-facing window 99 in the distal region of the trocar tube allows the passage of ultrasound energy from and to the transducer to enable imaging to take place. The hollow trocar tube serves further to prevent crushing or deformation of the ultrasound catheter under the considerable pressure required to drive the device into solid body tissue. After ultrasound inspection the imaging catheter may be withdrawn from this device and a biopsy device may then be inserted in its place with the advantage that the region from which the biopsy is to be taken has been very accurately located by acoustic imaging.
FIG. 21 shows flexible, disposable sheath 12i made of integral, thin-walled extruded plastic which is more or less sonolucent. This construction avoids the necessity of having a separate dome or window attached to the distal end. The distal end is post formed (thinned, e.g. by drawing and blowing) after extrusion to provide the correct wall thickness dimension for best sonic transmission and mechanical strength and may be sealed fluid tight at the tip.
FIG. 22 shows sheath 12j which is similar to sheath 12i of FIG. 21, and additionally has an integral floppy tip made by continuing the drawing process to form a small diameter solid but flexible extension of the sheath beyond the sonoluscent area; it can achieve certain of the advantages of catheter 12a of FIG. 13 but without the additional cost of adding a separate metal floppy guide wire.
FIG. 23 shows sheath 12k which is formed to have an inner end bearing surface 101 at the distal tip for serving as an axial and radial bearing for the rotating ultrasound transducer. This bearing is e.g. a small spherical or conical formation. By applying an axial, distal thrust on the shaft, and axial proximal tension on the catheter sheath, this bearing action creates tension on the tapered area of the dome, thus maintaining its shape by stretching, and allowing an even thinner material to be used, to reduce loss of acoustic energy in the substance of the window.
FIG. 24 shows sheath 121 which is fitted with a keyed rotating shaft that accepts the end of a similarly keyed ultrasound transducer, and acts as a power takeoff for driving a rotatable instrument such as the atherectomy cutter 105, shown.
FIGS. 25-25c show a sheath constructed along the lines of sheath 12a of FIG. 13, being used in guiding and penetrating through the moving opening of a human heart valve. It shows how the floppy guiding wire acts as a stabilizer and a centering device allowing the ultrasound device to be moved forward and withdrawn repeatedly and consistently, as is desirable for proper imaging of the valve before and after valvuloplasty.
FIG. 26 shows an integrally formed catheter sheath having an acoustic window 24i originally of the same extruded material as the body of the catheter, the material of the window being modified to enhance its acoustic window properties. In this embodiment the main body 12mb of the sheath has wall thickness t of 0.4 mm and outer diameter D of 2 mm. The integral window 24i has outer diameter D corresponding to that of the main body of the catheter and a modified wall thickness tl of 0.2 mm.
Any of these catheters may be additionally fitted with radioopaque markers either at the tip or the middle or both, designed to be visible when seen under the fluoroscope while intraluminal ultrasound imaging takes place.

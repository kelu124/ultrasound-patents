An improved can end (11) of the type openable with- transducers uses an optical encoder for generating indexing signals. A slipring and brush assembly (34, 38) interconnects the transducers and electronic circuitry (32) within the scanner.

This invention relates generally to ultrasonic scanners such as used for medical diagnostic purposes, and more particularly the invention relates to an ultrasonic sector scanner in which a plurality of rotating transducers are selectively energized for scanning.
    Ultrasonic diagnostic systems are known and commercially available for diagnostic purposes. See for example U. S. Patent No. 4,172,386 for "Video A Trace Display System for Ultrasonic Diagnostic System" and U. S. Patent No. 4,204,423 for "Computerized Ultrasonic Scanner With Technique Select". The commercially available Datason ultrasound system of General Electric Company provides both real time and static images on a television display.
    Briefly, such systems utilize scund transducers to transmit ultrasonic (e.g. on the order of several megahertz) waves into a patient and to receive echo signals. In one mode of operation, the transducer is attached to a plurality of hinged arms for movement in a single plane, and potentiometers associated with the hinged arms produce signals whith identify the transducer position. Alternatively, a transducer array or a hand held transducer can be used. The echo signals are applied to a time gain compensated amplifier to adjust the echo signals for attenuation in passing through the patient. The adjusted signals are then passed through an analog to digital conversion and video processing circuitry and thence to scan converter circuitry for display formatting. The display comprises a plurality of pixels in horizontal rows and vertical columns with each pixel having a brightness level in response to the input signal. Conventionally, the brightness is defined by a 32 level Gray-scale, hence the pixel brightness level requires a five bit digital code.
    The hand-held unit or sector scanner can utilize a phased transducer array, an oscillating transducer, or a rotating transducer array. The phased array offers a high sample rate but is-more expensive that the comparable designs. The oscillating transducer is a simple design and- relatively compact. However, the oscillating transducer has a variable speed, thus uneven line spacing and typically a small sector angle. The rotating transducer array offers uniform transducer speed and a wider sector angle than does the oscillating transducer. However, the transducers must be accurately activated in time sequence. Heretofore, the position and orientation requirements have necessitated tightly controlled piece part tolerances and assembly tooling. This has resulted in expensive parts, high rejection rates, and restricted serviceability.
    Accordingly, an object of the present invention is an improved sector scanner utilizing rotating transducers..
    Another object of the invention is a sector scanner utilizing rotating transducers which are reliably coupled to electronic circuitry of the scanner.
    Still another object of the invention is timing means integral with the rotating transducers for accurately controlling each transducer in proper sequence.
    Yet another object of the invention is a sector scanner which is lower in cost and has increased serviceability.
    A feature of the invention is a slip ring and brush assembly for electrically coupling the rotating transducers to electronic circuitry.
    Another feature of the invention is optical indexing means integral with the slip ring assembly for providing a timing index for the sector scanner.
    Briefly, an ultrasonic sector scanner in accordance with the invention includes a housing, a shaft rotatably mounted in the housing, and a motor mounted within the housing and coupled to rotate the shaft. A transducer support wheel is coupled to the shaft for rotating a plurality of transducers, and electronic circuitry is mounted within the housing for controlling the transducers in processing electrical signals therefrom. Means is provided for electrically connecting the electronic circuitry and the transducer means including a plurality of slip-rings positioned on the shaft and a plurality of brushes which engage the plurality of slip- rings. First conductive means electrically interconnects the brushes and the electronic circuitry, and second conductive means interconnects the slip-rings and transducers.
    More particularly, the brushes are mounted to and comprise a part of a support block which is mounted within the housing in association with the slip rings. In accordance with another feature of the invention an optical emitter and an optical detector are mounted in spaced alignment in the brush support block. A disc having a notch in a peripheral portion is mounted on the shaft with the disc passing between the optical emitter and the optical detector whereby a signal is generated by the optical detector in response to light passage through the notch. Thus, a timing index signal properly coordinated with the position of the rotating transducers is generated and provided to the electronic control circuitry.
    The invention and objects and features thereof will be mors readily apparent from the following detailed description and appended claims when taken with the drawing, in which:
   Figure 1 is a perspective view of an ultrasonic sector scanner. Figure 2 is a second view of the sector scanner of Figure 1 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Figure 3 is a plan view of a slip-ring and brush assembly and optical indexing means in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Figure 4 is a side view of the slip-ring brush assembly of Figure 3 taken along the line 4-4. 
   Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of an ultrasonic sector scanner which includes a housing 10 of suitable configuration for manual support by an operator. Housing 10 is enlarged at the end portion 12 to accommodate a rotating transducer assembly as will be described further hereinbelow. Ports 14 and 16 provide for the transmission of ultrasonic energy from the transducers within the housing portion 12 and a patient undergoing examination. Signals received by the transducers are passed through internal electronics within housing 10 and through cable 18 to external computer means (not shown) for processing and display
    Figure 2 is a section view of the sector scanner of Figure with features in accordance with the present invention. Mounted within housing 10 is an electric motor 20 which rotates a hollow shaft 22. Rotatably mounted on shaft 22 within the housing portion 12 is a transducer assembly shown generally at 24. The transducer assembly includes a plurality of transducers (e.g. four) which are selectively actuated to transmit ultrasound energy through the ports 14 and 16 through use of the acoustic mirrors 26, 28, and 30. Use of such acoustic mirrors is well known in the art and does not comprise part of the present invention. The transducer assembly is further described in copending application A-3703
    Connected to the cable 18 is an electronic assembly 32 for controlling the transducer array and for processing electrical signals from the transducer array. In accordance with a feature of the present invention the electronic circuitry shown generally at 32 is electrically interconnected with the transducer array through means of a plurality of brushes shown generally at 34 which are mounted in a brush block assembly 36 and which electrically and physically engage slip-rings 38 mounted on the rotating shaft 22. Conductive cable within the shaft 22 electrically interconnects the slip-rings 38 and the transducers, and conductive means interconnects the brushes 34 and the circuitry 32.
    An indexing signal for identifying the position of the transducer assembly 24 is provided to the electronic control circuitry 32 by electro-optical means including an optical transmitter 40 such as light emitting diode and an optical detector 42 which are mounted in spaced alignment in the brush block assembly 36. Mounted on shaft 22 is an indexing disc 44 the periphery of which passes between the electro-optical transmitter 40 and detector 42. A notch 46 is provided in a peripheral portion of the disc 44 whereby the transmission of light through the notch from transmitter 40 to detector 42 causes detector 42 to generate an electrical index signal that is transmitted to the circuitry 32. Thus, by physically positioning the disc 44 and notch 46 on shaft 22 in proper alignment with the transducer assembly 24, the indexing signal from optical detector 42 provides a necessary timing reference for the control circuitry 32.
    Figures 3 and 4 are more detailed drawinga of the brush support block 36 and slip-rings of the embodiment of Figure 2. The electronic circuitry 32 is interconnected by the conductors 50 to the brushes 34 which are suitably mounted such as by molding in the support block 36. The indexing disc 44 is integral with bushing 54 about which the slip-rings 38 are mounted. Electrical conductors 56 are positioned within the hollow shaft 22 and electrically connect the slip-rings 38 and the transducer assembly.
    As shown in the side view of Figure 4, each brush 38 is preferably U shaped with both legs of the brush engaging a slip-ring 38 on opposing sides. The brush support block 36 may be mounted to the underside of a printed' circuit board for the electronics 32 by fastener means extending through the holes 60 and 62.
    The brush block assembly, slip-rings, and the indexing means are relatively simple in design, and the parts are readily assembled and calibrated with respect to the transducer assembly. Thus, the ultrasonic sector scanner embodying the invention is less expensive and readily serviceable.

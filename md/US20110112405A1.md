CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
   This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional No. 61/059,477 filed Jun. 6, 2008, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference, herein.
 BACKGROUND
   Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to ultrasound treatment and imaging devices and more specifically relate to ultrasound devices having a transducer probe operable to emit and receive ultrasound energy for cosmetic treatment and imaging.
    In general, a popular cosmetic procedure for reducing wrinkles on the brow region of a patient's face is a brow lift, during which portions of muscle, fat, fascia and other tissues in the brow region are invasively cut, removed, and/or paralyzed to help reduce or eliminate wrinkles from the brow. Traditionally, the brow lift requires an incision beginning at one ear and continuing around the forehead at the hair line to the other ear. A less invasive brow lift procedure is known as an endoscopic lift during which smaller incisions are made along the forehead and an endoscope and surgical cutting tools are inserted within the incisions to cut, remove, manipulate, or paralyze tissue to reduce or eliminate wrinkles from the brow.
    Even less invasive cosmetic treatments are designed to inject a neurotoxin in the brow. This procedure paralyzes muscles within the brow which can assist in reducing wrinkles. However, such procedures are temporary, can require chronic usage to sustain the intended effects, and can have deleterious effects.
 SUMMARY
   There is a need for non-invasive cosmetic procedures for reducing wrinkles in the head and neck, such as in a brow region, and in other regions. In addition, there is a need for non-invasive cosmetic procedures that result in a tightening of skin in the head and neck, including the brow region, and other regions. Further, there is a need to effectively and efficiently image the region of the skin that is targeted for treatment. In several of the embodiments described herein, the procedure is entirely cosmetic and not a medical act.
    Accordingly, several embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for cosmetic treatment and imaging. In various embodiments the treatment system includes a hand wand with at least one finger activated control, or controller, and a removable transducer module having at least one ultrasound transducer. In one embodiment, the system includes a control module that is coupled to the hand wand and has a graphic user interface for controlling the removable transducer module that has an interface coupling the hand wand to the control module. In an aspect of the embodiment, the interface provides power to the hand wand and/or transfers a signal from the hand wand to the control module. In various embodiments of the present invention, the cosmetic treatment and imaging system is used in aesthetic procedures on a portion of a head of patient, including the face, scalp, neck and/or ears of a patient.

In one embodiment, the fluid-filled transducer module includes a gel adapted to enhance transmission of an ultrasonic signal. In one embodiment, a gel adapted to enhance transmission of an ultrasonic signal is placed between the transducer and the patient's skin.
    In accordance with one embodiment of a hand wand for use in cosmetic treatment, the wand includes a first controlling device operably controlling an ultrasonic imaging function, a second controlling device operably controlling an ultrasonic treatment function, and a movement mechanism configured to create a linear sequence of individual thermal lesions with the second controlling device. In one embodiment, the movement mechanism is configured to be automated and programmable by a user. In one embodiment, the wand includes a transducer module operably coupled to at least one of the first controlling device, the second controlling device and the movement mechanism. In one embodiment, the linear sequence of individual thermal lesions has a treatment spacing in a range from about 0.01 mm to about 25 mm. In one embodiment, the movement mechanism is configured to be programmed to provide variable spacing between the individual thermal lesions. In one embodiment the individual thermal lesions are discrete. In one embodiment the individual thermal lesions are overlapping.
    In accordance with one embodiment of a variable ultrasonic parameter ultrasonic system for use in cosmetic treatment, the system includes a first controlling device, a second controlling device, a movement mechanism, and one or more removable transducer modules. In various embodiments, the one or more removable transducer modules includes two, three, four, five, six, or more removable transducer modules. In various embodiments, the different numbers of removable transducer modules can be configured for different or variable ultrasonic parameters. For example, in various non-limiting embodiments, the ultrasonic parameter can relate to transducer geometry, size, timing, spatial configuration, frequency, variations in spatial parameters, variations in temporal parameters, coagulation formation, depth, width, absorption coefficient, refraction coefficient, tissue depths, and/or other tissue characteristics. In various embodiments, a variable ultrasonic parameter may be altered, or varied, in order to effect the formation of a lesion for the desired cosmetic approach. In various embodiments, a variable ultrasonic parameter may be altered, or varied, in order to effect the formation of a lesion for the desired clinical approach. By way of example, one variable ultrasonic parameter relates to aspects of configurations associated with tissue depth. For example, some non-limiting embodiments of removable transducer modules can be configured for a tissue depth of 3 mm, 4.5 mm, 6 mm, less than 3 mm, between 3 mm and 4.5 mm, more than more than 4.5 mm, more than 6 mm, and anywhere in the ranges of 0-3 mm, 0-4.5 mm, 0-25 mm, 0-100 mm, and any depths therein. In one embodiment, an ultrasonic system is provided with two transducer modules, in which the first module applies treatment at a depth of about 4.5 mm and the second module applies treatment at a depth of about 3 mm. An optional third module that applies treatment at a depth of about 1.5-2 mm is also provided. A combination of two or more treatment modules is particularly advantageous because it permits treatment of a patient at varied tissue depths, thus providing synergistic results and maximizing the clinical results of a single treatment session. For example, treatment at multiple depths under a single surface region permits a larger overall volume of tissue treatment, which results in enhanced collagen formation and tightening. Additionally, treatment at different depths affects different types of tissue, thereby producing different clinical effects that together provide an enhanced overall cosmetic result. For example, superficial treatment may reduce the visibility of wrinkles and deeper treatment may induce formation of more collagen growth.
    Although treatment of a subject at different depths in one session may be advantageous in some embodiments, sequential treatment over time may be beneficial in other embodiments. For example, a subject may be treated under the same surface region at one depth in week 1, a second depth in week 2, etc. The new collagen produced by the first treatment may be more sensitive to subsequent treatments, which may be desired for some indications. Alternatively, multiple depth treatment under the same surface region in a single session may be advantageous because treatment at one depth may synergistically enhance or supplement treatment at another depth (due to, for example, enhanced blood flow, stimulation of growth factors, hormonal stimulation, etc.).
    In several embodiments, different transducer modules provide treatment at different depths. In several embodiments, a system comprising different transducers, each having a different depth, is particularly advantageous because it reduces the risk that a user will inadvertently select an incorrect depth. In one embodiment, a single transducer module can be adjusted or controlled for varied depths. Safety features to minimize the risk that an incorrect depth will be selected can be used in conjunction with the single module system.
    In several embodiments, a method of treating the lower face and neck area (e.g., the submental area) is provided. In several embodiments, a method of treating (e.g., softening) mentolabial folds is provided. In other embodiments, a method of treating the eye region is provided. Upper lid laxity improvement and periorbital lines and texture improvement will be achieved by several embodiments by treating at variable depths. In one embodiment, a subject is treated with about 40-50 lines at depths of 4.5 and 3 mm. The subject is optionally treated with about 40-50 lines at a depth of about 1.5-2 mm. The subject is optionally treated with about 40-50 lines at a depth of about 6 mm. By treating at varied depths in a single treatment session, optimal clinical effects (e.g., softening, tightening) can be achieved.
    In several embodiments, the treatment methods described herein are non-invasive cosmetic procedures. In some embodiments, the methods can be used in conjunction with invasive procedures, such as surgical facelifts or liposuction, where skin tightening is desired.

    In accordance to various embodiments of the present invention, an emitter-receiver module 200 can be coupled to the hand wand 100. In some embodiments an emitter-receiver module 200 can emit and receive energy, such as ultrasonic energy. In one embodiment, an emitter-receiver module 200 can be configured to only emit energy, such as ultrasonic energy. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 is permanently attachable to the hand wand 100. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 is attachable to and detachable from the hand wand 100. The emitter-receiver module 200 can be mechanically coupled to the hand wand 100 using a latch or coupler 140. An interface guide 235 can be useful in assisting the coupling of the emitter-receiver module 200 to the hand wand 100. In addition, the emitter-receiver module 200 can be electronically coupled to the hand wand 100 and such coupling may include an interface which is in communication with the controller 300. In one embodiment, an electric coupler at the interface guide 235, located at a proximal end of an emitter-receiver module 200 provides for electronic communication between the emitter-receiver module 200 and the hand wand 100, which can both be in electric communication with a controller 300. The emitter-receiver module 200 can comprise various probe and/or transducer configurations. For example, the emitter-receiver module 200 can be configured for a combined dual-mode imaging/therapy transducer, coupled or co-housed imaging/therapy transducers, or simply a separate therapy probe and an imaging probe. In one embodiment, the hand wand 100 includes a handle with an integrated receptacle for insertion of an emitter-receiver module 200 containing at least a transducer on one end and an electrical cable for attachment to the controller 200 on the other end.
    With additional reference to the illustrations in FIGS. 2 and 3, the hand wand 100 can be designed for ergonomic considerations to improve comfort, functionality and/or ease of use of the hand wand 100 by a user, such as, for example, a practitioner or medical professional.

In one embodiment, the hand wand 100 contains an electronic interface 175 (not illustrated here, but see other figures) in communication with at least one of the imaging button 150 and the treatment button 160. In accordance with one embodiment, the electronic interface 175 can interface with an outside source such as, for example, the controller 300. In various embodiments, the indictor 145 can be an LED, a light, an audio signal, and combinations thereof. In one aspect of the embodiments, the indicator 155 is a LED which can change colors based on different states of the CTS 20. For example the indicator 155 can be one color (or off) in a standby mode, a second color in an imaging mode and a third color in a treatment mode.
    In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 is configured to removably attach both electronically and mechanically with a hand wand 100. In one embodiment, a motion mechanism 400 (see FIG. 7) is configured to move an ultrasonic transducer 280 in an emitter-receiver module 200 such as is illustrated in various embodiments in FIGS. 4-6. A user can remove the indicated transducer module from its protective, resealable pouch, setting aside the pouch for storing the transducer module between procedures, if necessary. In one embodiment, a hand wand 100 and an emitter-receiver module 200 can be connected by pushing the coupler 140 upwards and sliding the emitter-receiver module 200 into the hand wand 100 as shown in FIG. 1. In one embodiment, when the emitter-receiver module 200 is inserted, the controller 300 automatically detects it and updates the interactive graphical display 310. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 locked into the hand wand 100 once the emitter-receiver module 200 is fully inserted and the coupler 140 at the tip of the hand wand 100 is pushed down. To disconnect the emitter-receiver module 200, the user can lift the coupler 140 at the tip of the hand wand 100 and slide the emitter-receiver module 200 out of the hand wand 100.
     FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate two opposing side views of an embodiment of an emitter-receiver module 200 comprising a housing 220 and an acoustically transparent member 230. In one embodiment, the housing 220 may include a cap 222 that is removable or permanently attachable to the housing 220. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 includes an interface guide 235 and/or one or more side guides 240 that can be useful in assisting the coupling of the emitter-receiver module 200 to the hand wand 100. The emitter-receiver module 200 can include a transducer 280 which can emit energy through an acoustically transparent member 230. The acoustically transparent member 230 can be a window, a filter and/or a lens. The acoustically transparent member 230 can be made of any material that is transparent to the energy that is that is emitted by the transducer 280. In one embodiment, the acoustically transparent member 230 is transparent to ultrasound energy.
    In various embodiments, the transducer 280 is in communication with the controller 300. In one embodiment, the transducer 280 is electronically coupled to the hand wand 100 and/or the controller 300. In one embodiment, the housing 220 is sealed by the cap 222 and the structure of the combination of the housing 220 and the cap 222 can hold a liquid (not shown). As illustrated in FIG. 6, an embodiment of the emitter-receiver module 200 housing 220 can have a port 275 which allows interfacing from the hand wand 100 into the transducer module 200 without affecting the integrity of the sealed structure of the housing 220 and the cap 222. Further, the cap 222 can include one or more ports. For example, a first port 292, a second port 293 and a third port 294. The ports in the cap 222 can be useful for electronically coupling the transducer 280 to the hand wand 100 and/or the controller 300. In one embodiment, at least one of the ports in the cap 222 may be used to interface a sensor 201 that may be useful in the emitter-receiver module 200. The sensor 201 can be in communication with the controller 300. More than one sensor 201 is used in some embodiments.
    In various embodiments, as illustrated in the block diagram of FIG. 6, the transducer 280 is movable within the emitter-receiver module 200. The transducer 280 is held by a transducer holder 289. In one embodiment, the transducer holder 289 includes a sleeve 287 which is moved along motion constraining bearings, such as linear bearings, namely, a bar (or shaft) 282 to ensure a repeatable linear movement of the transducer 280. In one embodiment, sleeve 287 is a spline bushing which prevents rotation about a spline shaft 282, but any guide to maintain the path of motion is appropriate. In one embodiment, the transducer holder 289 is driven by a motion mechanism 400, which may be located in the hand wand 100 or in the emitter-receiver module 200. The motion mechanism 400, as is discussed below in relation to FIG. 7, includes a scotch yoke 403 with a movement member 432 and a magnetic coupling 433 on a distal end of the movement member 432. The magnet coupling 433 helps move the transducer 280. One benefit of a motion mechanism such as motion mechanism 400 is that it provides for a more efficient, accurate and precise use of an ultrasound transducer 280, for both imaging and for therapy purposes. One advantage this type of motion mechanism has over conventional fixed arrays of multiple transducers fixed in space in a housing is that the fixed arrays are a fixed distance apart. By placing transducer 280 on a linear track under controller 300 control, embodiments of the system and device provide for adaptability and flexibility in addition to the previously mentioned efficiency, accuracy and precision. Real time and near real time adjustments can be made to imaging and treatment positioning along the controlled motion by the motion mechanism 400. In addition to the ability to select nearly any resolution based on the incremental adjustments made possible by the motion mechanism 400, adjustments can be made if imaging detects abnormalities or conditions meriting a change in treatment spacing and targeting.
    In one embodiment, one or more sensors 201 may be included in the emitter-receiver module 200. In one embodiment, one or more sensors 201 may be included in the emitter-receiver module 200 to ensure that a mechanical coupling between the movement member 432 and the transducer holder 289 is indeed coupled. In one embodiment, an encoder 283 may be positioned on top of the transducer holder 289 and a sensor 201 may be located in a dry portion of the emitter-receiver module 200, or vice versa (swapped). In various embodiments the sensor 201 is a magnetic sensor, such as a giant magnetoresistive effect (GMR) or Hall Effect sensor, and the encoder a magnet, collection of magnets, or multi-pole magnetic strip. The sensor may be positioned as a transducer module home position. In one embodiment, the sensor 201 is a contact pressure sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor 201 is a contact pressure sensor on a surface of the device to sense the position of the device or the transducer on the patient. In various embodiments, the sensor 201 can be used to map the position of the device or a component in the device in one, two, or threes dimensions. In one embodiment the sensor 201 is configured to sense the position, angle, tilt, orientation, placement, elevation, or other relationship between the device (or a component therein) and the patient. In one embodiment, the sensor 201 comprises an optical sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor 201 comprises a roller ball sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor 201 is configured to map a position in one, two and/or three dimensions to compute a distance between areas or lines of treatment on the skin or tissue on a patient. Motion mechanism 400 can be any motion mechanism that may be found to be useful for movement of the transducer 280. Other embodiments of motion mechanisms useful herein can include worm gears and the like. In various embodiments of the present invention, the motion mechanism is located in the emitter-receiver module 200. In various embodiments, the motion mechanism can provide for linear, rotational, multi-dimensional motion or actuation, and the motion can include any collection of points and/or orientations in space. Various embodiments for motion can be used in accordance with several embodiments, including but not limited to rectilinear, circular, elliptical, arc-like, spiral, a collection of one or more points in space, or any other 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D positional and attitudinal motional embodiments. The speed of the motion mechanism 400 may be fixed or may be adjustably controlled by a user. One embodiment, a speed of the motion mechanism 400 for an image sequence may be different than that for a treatment sequence. In one embodiment, the speed of the motion mechanism 400 is controllable by the controller 300.
    Transducer 280 can have a travel distance 272 such that an emitted energy 50 is able to be emitted through the acoustically transparent member 230. In one embodiment, the travel 272 is described as end-to-end range of travel of the transducer 280. In one embodiment, the travel 272 of the transducer 280 can be between about 100 mm and about 1 mm. In one embodiment, the length of the travel 272 can be about 25 mm. In one embodiment, the length of the travel 272 can be about 15 mm. In one embodiment, the length of the travel 272 can be about 10 mm. In various embodiments the length of the travel 272 can be about between 0-25 mm, 0-15 mm, 0-10 mm.
    The transducer 280 can have an offset distance 270, which is the distance between the transducer 280 and the acoustically transparent member 230. In various embodiments of the present invention, the transducer 280 can image and treat a region of interest of about 25 mm and can image a depth less than about 10 mm. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 has an offset distance 270 for a treatment at a depth 278 of about 4.5 mm below the skin surface 501 (see FIG. 15).
    in various embodiments, transducer modules 200 can be configured for different or variable ultrasonic parameters. For example, in various non-limiting embodiments, the ultrasonic parameter can relate to aspects of the transducer 280, such as geometry, size, timing, spatial configuration, frequency, variations in spatial parameters, variations in temporal parameters, coagulation formation, depth, width, absorption coefficient, refraction coefficient, tissue depths, and/or other tissue characteristics. In various embodiments, a variable ultrasonic parameter may be altered, or varied, in order to effect the formation of a lesion for the desired cosmetic approach. In various embodiments, a variable ultrasonic parameter may be altered, or varied, in order to effect the formation of a lesion for the desired clinical approach. By way of example, one variable ultrasonic parameter relates to configurations associated with tissue depth 278. In several embodiments, the transducer module 200 is configured for both ultrasonic imaging and ultrasonic treatment and is operably coupled to at least one controlling device 150, 160 and a movement mechanism 400. The transducer module 200 is configured to apply ultrasonic therapy at a first ultrasonic parameter and a second ultrasonic parameter. In various embodiments, the first and second ultrasonic parameters are selected from the group consisting of: variable depth, variable frequency, and variable geometry. For example, in one embodiment, a single transducer module 200 delivers ultrasonic therapy at two or more depths 278, 278′. In another embodiment, two or more interchangeable transducer modules 200 each provide a different depth 278 (e.g., one module treats at 3 mm depth while the other treats at a 4.5 mm depth). In yet another embodiment, a single transducer module 200 delivers ultrasonic therapy at two or more frequencies, geometries, amplitudes, velocities, wave types, and/or wavelengths. In other embodiments, two or more interchangeable transducer modules 200 each provide a different parameter value. In one embodiment, a single transducer module 200 may provide at least two different depths 278, 278′ and at least two different frequencies (or other parameter). Variable parameter options are particularly advantageous in certain embodiments because they offer enhanced control of tissue treatment and optimize lesion formation, tissue coagulation, treatment volume, etc.
     FIG. 15 illustrates one embodiment of a depth 278 that corresponds to a muscle depth. In various embodiments, the depth 278 can correspond to any tissue, tissue layer, skin, dermis, fat, SMAS, muscle, or other tissue. In some embodiments, different types of tissue are treated to provide synergistic effects, thus optimizing clinical results. In another embodiment, the emitter-receiver module has an offset distance 270 for a treatment at a depth 278 of about 3.0 mm below the surface 501. In various embodiments, this offset distance may be varied such that the transducer 280 can emit energy to a desired depth 278 below a surface 501. In various embodiments, in a treatment mode, bursts of acoustic energy from the transducer 280 can create a linear sequence of individual thermal lesions 550. In one embodiment the individual thermal lesions 550 are discrete. In one embodiment the individual thermal lesions 550 are overlapping. In various embodiments, the transducer 280 can image to a depth roughly between 1 and 100 mm. In one embodiment, the transducer imaging depth can be approximately 20 mm. In one embodiment, the transducer 280 can treat to a depth of between about zero (0) to 25 mm. In one embodiment, the transducer treatment depth can be approximately 4.5 mm.
    In any of the embodiments described herein, the transducer treatment depth can be approximately 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 4.5 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, or any other depth in the range of 0-100 mm. Varied depth treatment, including treatment of the same tissue at different depths or treatment of different tissues, can increase clinical results by providing synergistic effects.
    In various embodiments of the present invention, a transducer 280 is capable of emitting ultrasound energy for imaging, diagnostics, or treating and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the transducer 280 is configured to emit ultrasound energy at a specific depth in a region of interest to target a region of interest of a specific tissue such as a corrugator supercilii muscle as described below. In this embodiment, the transducer 280 may be capable of emitting unfocused or defocused ultrasound energy over a wide area of the region of interest 65 for treatment purposes (see FIGS. 12 and 22). In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 contains a transducer 280 that can image and treat a region of tissue up to 25 mm long and can image a depth of up to 8 millimeters. Treatment occurs along a line less than or equal to the transducer's active length, which is indicated in one embodiment by guide marks (not illustrated here) on the sides of the emitter-receiver module 200 near a acoustically transparent member 230 along the surface adjacent to the patient's skin. In one embodiment, a marked guide at the front tip of the transducer 280 represents the center of the treatment line. In one embodiment of a treatment mode, bursts of sound energy create a linear sequence of individual thermal coagulation zones. In one embodiment the individual thermal coagulation zones are discrete. In one embodiment the individual thermal coagulation zones are overlapping. A label (not illustrated here) may be applied or etched on a side or top surface of the emitter-receiver module 200 to provide the transducer 280 type, expiration date, and other information. In one embodiment, an emitter-receiver module 200 can be configured with a label for tracking the type transducer 280 used, treatment frequency and treatment depth, a unique serial number, a part number, and date of manufacture. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver modules 200 are disposable. In one embodiment, the system tracks use of the emitter-receiver modules 200 in order to determine the remaining life of the emitter-receiver module 200 as transducer life diminishes over time and/or usage. Once a transducer 280 has diminished capacity, the emitter-receiver module 200 may work less effectively in performing its functions. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 or controller 300 will track usage and prevent additional usage of an emitter-receiver module 200 beyond a recommended usage life in order to preserve the safety and effectiveness of the device. This safety feature can be configured based on test data.
    In one embodiment, an emitter-receiver module 200 is configured with a treatment frequency of approximately 4 MHz, a treatment depth of approximately 4.5 mm and an imaging depth range of roughly 0-8 mm. In one embodiment, an emitter-receiver module 200 is configured with a treatment frequency of approximately 7 MHz, a treatment depth of approximately 3.0 mm and an imaging depth range of roughly 0-8 mm. In one embodiment, an emitter-receiver module 200 is configured with a treatment frequency of approximately 7 MHz, a treatment depth of approximately 4.5 mm and an imaging depth range of roughly 0-8 mm.
    Transducer 280 may comprise one or more transducers for facilitating imaging and/or treatment. The transducer 280 may comprise a piezoelectrically active material, such as, for example, lead zirconante titanate, or other piezoelectrically active materials such as, but not limited to, a piezoelectric ceramic, crystal, plastic, and/or composite materials, as well as lithium niobate, lead titanate, barium titanate, and/or lead metaniobate, including piezoelectric, electrically conductive, and plastic film layers deposited on spherically focused backing material. In addition to, or instead of, a piezoelectrically active material, the transducer 280 may comprise any other materials configured for generating radiation and/or acoustical energy. The transducer 280 may also comprise one or more matching and/or backing layers coupled to the piezoelectrically active material. The transducer 280 may also be configured with single or multiple damping elements.
    In one embodiment, the thickness of a transduction element of the transducer 280 may be configured to be uniform. That is, the transduction element may be configured to have a thickness that is generally substantially the same throughout. In another embodiment, the transduction element may also be configured with a variable thickness, and/or as a multiple damped device. For example, the transduction element of the transducer 280 may be configured to have a first thickness selected to provide a center operating frequency of a lower range, for example from about 1 MHz to about 10 MHz. The transduction element may also be configured with a second thickness selected to provide a center operating frequency of a higher range, for example from about 10 MHz to greater than 100 MHz.
    In yet another embodiment, the transducer 280 is configured as a single broadband transducer excited with two or more frequencies to provide an adequate output for raising a temperature within a treatment area of the region of interest to the desired level as discussed herein. The transducer 280 may be configured as two or more individual transducers, such that each transducer 280 may comprise a transduction element. The thickness of the transduction elements may be configured to provide center-operating frequencies in a desired treatment range. For example, in one embodiment, the transducer 280 may comprise a first transducer configured with a first transduction element having a thickness corresponding to a center frequency range of about 1 MHz to about 10 MHz, and a second transducer configured with a second transduction element having a thickness corresponding to a center frequency range of about 10 MHz to greater than 100 MHz. Various other combinations and ranges of thickness for a first and/or second transduction element can be designed to focus at specific depths below a surface 501, for specific frequency ranges, and/or specific energy emissions.
    The transduction elements of the transducer 280 can be configured to be concave, convex, and/or planar. In one embodiment, the transduction elements are configured to be concave in order to provide focused energy for treatment of the region of interest. Additional embodiments of transducers are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/944,500, entitled “System and Method for Variable Depth Ultrasound Treatment,” incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
    Moreover, the transducer 280 can be any distance from the surface 501. In that regard, it can be far away from the surface 501 disposed within a long transducer or it can be just a few millimeters from the surface 501. This distance can be determined by design using the offset distance 270 as described herein. In certain embodiments, positioning the transducer 280 closer to the surface 501 is better for emitting ultrasound at higher frequencies. Moreover, both two and three dimensional arrays of elements can be used in the present invention. Furthermore, the transducer 280 may comprise a reflective surface, tip, or area at the end of the transducer 280 that emits ultrasound energy. This reflective surface may enhance, magnify, or otherwise change ultrasound energy emitted from the CTS 20.
    In various embodiments any set of one or more transducers 280 can be used for various functions, such as separate treat/image or dual-mode (both treat/image) transducers or a treat-only version. In various embodiments the imaging element(s) can be on the side (adjacent to) or at any relative position, attitude, and/or height, or even within the therapy element(s). One or more therapy depths and frequencies can be used and one or more imaging elements or one or more dual-mode elements. In various embodiments any controllable means of moving the active transduction element(s) within the emitter-receiver module 200 housing constitute viable embodiments.
    In various embodiments, the emitter-receiver module 200 can also be configured in various manners and comprise a number of reusable and/or disposable components and parts in various embodiments to facilitate its operation. For example, the emitter-receiver module 200 can be configured within any type of transducer probe housing or arrangement for facilitating the coupling of the transducer 280 to a tissue interface, with such housing comprising various shapes, contours and configurations. The emitter-receiver module 200 can comprise any type of matching, such as for example, electric matching, which may be electrically switchable, multiplexer circuits and/or aperture/element selection circuits, and/or probe identification devices, to certify probe handle, electric matching, transducer usage history and calibration, such as one or more serial EEPROM (memories).
    In various embodiments, the emitter-receiver module 200 may also comprise cables and connectors, motion mechanisms, motion sensors and encoders, thermal monitoring sensors, and/or user control and status related switches, and indicators such as LEDs. In one embodiment, a motion mechanism similar to the motion mechanism 400 described in the hand wand 100 may be used to drive the emitter-receiver module 200 from within the emitter-receiver module 200. In one embodiment, a hand wand 100 is electrically connectable to the emitter-receiver module 200 to drive the emitter-receiver module 200 from within itself. In various embodiments, a motion mechanism (in any of the embodiments described herein) may be used to controllably create multiple lesions, or sensing of probe motion itself may be used to controllably create multiple lesions and/or stop creation of lesions 550, as discussed herein. For example in one embodiment, for safety reasons if the emitter-receiver module 200 is suddenly jerked or is dropped, a sensor can relay this action to the controller 300 to initiate a corrective action or shut down the emitter-receiver module 200. In addition, an external motion encoder arm may be used to hold the probe during use, whereby the spatial position and attitude of the emitter-receiver module 200 is sent to the controller 300 to help controllably create lesions 550. Furthermore, other sensing functionality such as profilometers or other imaging modalities may be integrated into the emitter-receiver module 200 in accordance with various embodiments. In one embodiment, pulse-echo signals to and from the emitter/receiver module 200 are utilized for tissue parameter monitoring of the treatment region 550.
    Coupling components can comprise various devices to facilitate coupling of the emitter-receiver module 200 to a region of interest. For example, coupling components can comprise cooling and acoustic coupling system configured for acoustic coupling of ultrasound energy and signals. Acoustic cooling/coupling system with possible connections such as manifolds may be utilized to couple sound into the region-of-interest, control temperature at the interface and deeper into tissue, provide liquid-filled lens focusing, and/or to remove transducer waste heat. The coupling system may facilitate such coupling through use of one or more coupling mediums, including air, gases, water, liquids, fluids, gels, solids, and/or any combination thereof, or any other medium that allows for signals to be transmitted between the transducer 280 and a region of interest. In one embodiment one or more coupling media is provided inside a transducer. In one embodiment a fluid-filled emitter-receiver module 200 contains one or more coupling media inside a housing. In one embodiment a fluid-filled emitter-receiver module 200 contains one or more coupling media inside a sealed housing, which is separable from a dry portion of an ultrasonic device.
    In addition to providing a coupling function, in accordance with one embodiment, the coupling system can also be configured for providing temperature control during the treatment application. For example, the coupling system can be configured for controlled cooling of an interface surface or region between the emitter-receiver module 200 and a region of interest and beyond by suitably controlling the temperature of the coupling medium. The suitable temperature for such coupling medium can be achieved in various manners, and utilize various feedback systems, such as thermocouples, thermistors or any other device or system configured for temperature measurement of a coupling medium. Such controlled cooling can be configured to further facilitate spatial and/or thermal energy control of the emitter-receiver module 200.
    In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 is connected to a motion mechanism 400 in the hand wand 100. In one embodiment, the motion mechanism 400 may be in the emitter-receiver module 200. One embodiment of a motion mechanism 400 is illustrated in FIG. 7, which depicts a two phase stepper motor 402 and a scotch yoke 403 to produce a linear motion. The stepper motor 402 rotates as indicated by arrow 405 which moves a pin 404 in a circular path. The pin 404 slides in a slot 406 of the scotch yoke 403. This causes the scotch yoke 403 to move in a linear fashion. The scotch yoke 403 is held by guides 410 and glide members 412 may be between the scotch yoke 403 and guide 410. In one embodiment, a guide 410 is a shoulder screw. Embodiments of the glide member 412 may include any material or mechanical device that lowers a coefficient of friction between the guide 410 and the scotch yoke 403, or any linear bearings. For example, in various embodiments the glide member 412 can be at least one of an elastomeric material, a lubricant, ball bearings, a polished surface, a magnetic device, pressurized gas, or any other material or device useful for gliding.

In one embodiment, the encoder strip 430 has one, two or more home positions which may be useful in calibrating for a position and travel of the scotch yoke 403.
    In one embodiment, the movement of the scotch yoke 403 is transferred through the movement mechanism 432 such that the transducer 280 moves in a linear fashion inside of the emitter-receiver module 200. In one embodiment, the scotch yoke 403 includes a movement member 432 and a magnetic coupling 433 on a distal end of the movement member 432. The movement member 432 can be sized to travel through or within a liquid-tight seal.

In one embodiment, the power may remain on as the lock 395 is unlocked and locked successively and different parameters are entered. A key 396 (not illustrated) may be needed to unlock the lock 395. Examples of keys 396 useful herein include a standard metal tooth and groove key, or an electronic key. In some embodiments, an electronic key 396 may be digitally encoded to include user information and collect data and/or time usage of CTS 20. In one embodiment, an electronic key is particularly useful with CTS 20 may be a USB drive with encryption such that inserting the USB drive key into lock 395 the CTS 20 may be activated. In various embodiments, a software key can be configured to indicate a condition or status to the user, lock the system, interrupt the system, or other feature.
    With reference to FIG. 9, a CTS 20 layout block diagram is illustrated according to various embodiments of the present invention. In accordance with the aspects of these embodiments, the controller 300 can include several electronic sections. Included in these electronic sections can be a power supply 350 which provides power to CTS 20 including the controller 300, the hand wand 100, and/or the emitter-receiver module 200. In one embodiment, the power supply 350 can supply power to a printer or other data output device. The controller 300 can include the controller subsystem 340 as described herein, the host 330, a graphical interface 310, an RF driver 352 and a front panel flex circuit 345. The RF driver 352 can provide power to the transducer 280. The embedded host 330 can be a host computer which may be used collecting user input, transferring it to the controller subsystem 340 and for displaying images and system statuses on the graphical interface 310. The power supply 350 can be convertible for use internationally based on different voltage inputs and typically is a medical grade power supply. The power supply may be plugged into a standard wall socket to draw power or may draw power from a battery or any other alternative source that may be available.
    The graphical interface 310 displays images and systems status as well as facilitates the user interface for entering commands to control the CTS 20. The controller subsystem 340 can control the imaging subsystem 350, the therapy subsystem 320, as well as interfacing and communicating treatment protocol to the hand wand 100 and the emitter-receiver module 200, as described herein. In one embodiment, the controller subsystem 340 not only sets treatment parameters but also monitors the status of such treatment and transfers such status to the host 330 for display on display/touch screen 310. The front panel flex circuit 345 can be a printed circuit cable that connects the controller 300 to the interface cable 130. In one embodiment, the cable 130 can include a quick connect or release, multi-pin connector plug which interfaces to the front panel flex circuit 345 as described herein. The cable 130 allows for interfacing of the controller 300 with the hand wand 100 and the emitter-receiver module 200 as described herein.
    Now with reference to FIG. 10, the hand wand 100 includes the hand piece imaging sub-circuits 110, encoder 420, sensor 425, image 150 and treat 160 switches, motor 402, status light 155, and interconnect and flex interconnect 420. The hand wand 100 interfaces with spring pin flex 106 and spring pin connector 422 which can be used for hardware, software and/or power interface from the hand wand 100 to the emitter-receiver module 200.
    In various embodiments of the present invention, the emitter-receiver module 200 can include a probe ID and connector PCB 224. The probe ID and connector PCB can include a secure EEPROM. The probe ID and connector PCB 224 can be interfaced with a PCB located in a dry portion of the emitter-receiver module 200 and interfaced with the transducer 280 The transducer 280 is typically located in the liquid portion of the emitter-receiver module 200. In one embodiment, the emitter-receiver module 200 can be connected to the hand wand 100 via the spring pin flex 106 and spring pin connector 422 which can be a twelve contact spring pin connector that is recessed in the hand wand 100. The spring pin flex 106 with its twelve contact spring pin connector can be connected to the probe ID and connector PCB 224 which can include gold plated contacts. In one embodiment, the probe ID and connector PCB 224 can include a usage counter that disables the emitter-receiver module 200 after a pre-set usage. In various embodiments, the pre-set usage can range from a single treatment sequence to multiple treatment sequences. In one embodiment, the pre-set usage is determined by a pre-set time on of the transducer 280. In one embodiment, the pre-set usage is a single cycle of treatment sequences. In this aspect, essentially the emitter-receiver module 200 is disposable after each use. In one embodiment, the system automatically shuts off or otherwise indicates to a user that the emitter-receiver module 200 should be replaced. The system may be programmed to shut off or otherwise indicate replacement based on at least one of usage time, energy delivered, shelf time, or a combination thereof.
    With further reference to FIG. 10, a block diagram illustrates an interconnection of the hand wand 100 and the emitter-receiver module 200. The hand wand 100 can include a therapy protection switch which can provide a electric isolation between treat and image functions. A transducer pulse generated by the controller subsystem 340 can be received by matching network 173. In one embodiment, a single transducer 280 can be used for therapy without imaging. In another embodiment one dual-mode transducer can be used for therapy and imaging. In another embodiment, two transducers 280 can be used for therapy and imaging. In yet another embodiment, therapy is done at relatively low frequencies (such as, in one embodiment, nominally 4 and 7 MHz) with a first transducer 280, and a second higher frequency transducer for imaging (such as, in one embodiment, 18-40 MHz or more).
    The imaging sub-circuits 110 can include a time gain control amplifier and tunable bypass filter which can receive echoes produced by the imaging portion of the transducer 280. The imaging can be controlled by imaging switch 150. Power can be transferred from the controller 300 via cable 130. Such power can be directed to the imaging sub-circuits 110, the image switch 150 and the treatment switch 160. Such power can also be provided to the stepper motor 402, the encoder 425, the probe IO switch 181, the hand wand temperature sensor 183, and a hand wand ID EEPROM 169. All of the electronics described in FIG. 10 for the hand wand 100 can be mounted on the circuit board with an interface to cable 130 and/or an interface to the emitter-receiver module 200.
    The emitter-receiver module 200 includes an interface connectable to the hand wand 100 as described in FIG. 9. The emitter-receiver module 200 can include any type of storage device 249. In one embodiment, the storage device 249 is part of the electric interface mating circuit board 224 and electric matching 243 circuit board. In one embodiment, the storage device 249 is a permanent storage device. In one embodiment, the storage device 249 is a non-volatile member. In one embodiment, the storage device 249 is an EEPROM. In one embodiment, the storage device 249 is a secure EEPROM. In one embodiment, a transducer PCB can contain calibration data and information storage in the secure EEPROM. Further in this aspect, the emitter-receiver module 200 includes a sensor which measures a fluid temperature of the fluid portion of the emitter-receiver module 200, a matching network 243 interfaced to the treatment portion of the transducer 280. In various embodiments, the storage device 249 can contain digital security information, build date, transducer focus depth, transducer power requirements, and the like. In one embodiment, the storage device 249 can include a timer which inactivates the emitter-receiver module 200 for use with CTS 20 after a predetermined shelf life has expired. The emitter-receiver module 200 can include a position encoder 283, such as a magnet, connected to the transducer 280 and a sensor 241, such as a Hall sensor, connected to the stationary emitter/receiver housing 220 via circuit board. The position encoder 283 and the position sensor 241 can act as a sensor for determining a transducer 280 home position and/or movement as described herein. The imaging portion of the transducer 280 can receive a transducer RF signal from the controller 300.
    Since it is possible for a user to potentially touch the spring pin flex contacts 422 when an emitter-receiver module 200 is not attached, the current must be able to be turned off in this situation to provide safety to the user. To provide such safety, contact pins 422 on opposite ends of the spring pin flex 106 can be used to detect an attachment of the emitter-receiver module 200 to the hand wand 100. As discussed above, motion mechanism 400 can be connected to the transducer 280 to provide linear movement of the transducer along the travel 272.
    In various embodiments, the CTS 20 can include various safety features to provide a safe environment for the user and/or the subject that receives treatment. One embodiment, the CTS 20 can include at least one of calibration data, safe operating area, high mismatch detect, high current detect, RF driver supply voltage monitoring, forward and reverse electric power monitoring, acoustic coupling detection, acoustic coupling complete, treatment position sensing, and combinations thereof.
    For example, calibration data can include certain characteristics for a given emitter-receiver module 200 that reside on the storage device 249. Such characteristics can include but are not limited to unique and traceable serial numbers, probe identification, frequency setting, acoustic power versus voltage lookup table, electric power versus voltage lookup table, maximum power levels, date codes, usage, other information, and/or combinations thereof. For example, a safe operating area safety feature limits energy output for a given emitter-receiver module 200 is limited to a safe operating area. Such a limitation may include for a given emitter-receiver module 200, the acoustic power level supplied by the power supply voltage and the time On may be limited in the hardware and/or software of the controller 300 and/or the emitter-receiver module 200.
    An example of a high mismatch detect safety feature can include if a fault occurs in reflective power from the load of the emitter-receiver module 200 is large as compared a forward power such as the emitter-receiver module 200 failure, open circuit, or high reflective energy, then a system Stop state would automatically and indefinitely be invoked by comparator circuit latched in the hardware of the controller 300 and a notification of such fault would appear on the display/touch screen 310 to alert the user. An example of a high current detect safety feature can include if a driver fault or load fault occurs such that a large current draw is detected such as for example a short circuit or electrical component failure, then a Stop state would be automatically and immediately invoked as located in the hardware of the controller 300 and a notice would be displayed on the display/touch screen 310 to alert the user.
    An example of RF driver supply voltage monitoring safety feature can include the CTS 20 measuring the RF driver power supply voltage setting before, during and after treatment to assure that the voltage is at the correct level. If it is determined that the voltage is outside the correct level, then a Stop state would be automatically and immediately invoked and a notice would be displayed on the display/touch screen 310 to alert the user. An example of a safety feature includes monitoring the stepper motor 402 during treatment and determining if it is in an acceptable range such that the transducer 280 is properly moving along the travel 272 at a predetermined rate or frequency. If it is determined that the stepper motor 402 is not at an expected position, a notification is issued to alert the user.
    An example of an acoustic coupling safety feature includes an imaging sequence that indicates to the user that the emitter-receiver module 200 is acoustically coupled to the surface 501 before and after treatment. An image sequence confirms that the transducer 280 is scanning a treatment area.
    Still further, other safety features may be included such as thermal monitoring, use of a stop switch, a probe sensor, or a combination thereof. An example of thermal monitoring can include monitoring the temperature of the liquid portion of the emitter-receiver module 200, monitoring the temperature of the hand wand 100, monitoring the temperature of the controller 300, monitoring the temperature of the controller subsystem 340 and/or monitoring the temperature of the RF driver 352. Such temperature monitoring assures that the devices described operate within temperatures that are acceptable and will provide notification if a temperature is outside an acceptable range thus alerting the user.
    A stop switch can be included in CTS 20 such that when a user hits the stop switch the system moves to a safe and inactive state upon activation of the stop switch. An example of a probe sense fail safe can include immediately stopping imaging and/or treatment if the emitter-receiver module 200 is disconnected from the hand wand 100 while in use. In one embodiment, the CTS 20 can include a system diagnostic which can include software checks for errors, unexpected events and usage. The system diagnostics may also include maintenance indicator that tracks the usage of the CTS 20 and notifies the user that maintenance is needed for the system. Other safety features may be included in the CTS 20 that are well known in the art such as fuses, system power supply over voltage and over current limiting, as well as standardized protections such as fire safety ratings, electrical safety ratings, ISO\EN 60601 compliance and the like.
    In various embodiments, the CTS 20 includes a removable transducer module 200 interfaced to a hand enclosure 100 having at least one controller button (150 and/or 160) such that the transducer module 200 and the controller button (150 and/or 160) is operable using only one hand. In an aspect of the embodiments, the transducer module 200 provides ultrasound energy for an imaging function and/or a treatment function. In another aspect of the embodiments, the device includes a controller 300 coupled to the hand-held enclosure 100 and interfaced to the transducer module 200. In a further aspect of these embodiments, the controller 300 controls the ultrasound energy of and receives a signal from the transducer module 200. The controller 300 can have a power supply providing power for the ultrasound energy. In still another aspect of the embodiments, the device is used in aesthetic imaging and treatment on a brow of a patient.
     FIG. 11 illustrates a schematic drawing of anatomical features of interest in the head and face region of a patient 500, including a trigeminal nerve 502, a facial nerve 504, a parotid gland 506 and a facial artery 508. In one embodiment, the anatomical features of interest are areas to be treated with care or to be noted, treated with care, or even avoided during treatment. FIGS. 12-14 illustrate one region of interest 65 (hereinafter “ROI 65”) and a cross-sectional tissue portion 10 along the line 23-23 of the ROI 65 on a subject 500, such as may be used for example when performing a brow lift. This cross-sectional tissue portion 10 can be located anywhere in the ROI 65 and can in any direction or of any length with in the ROT 65. Of course, the subject 500 can be a patient that may be treated with a brow lift. The cross-sectional portion tissue 10 includes a surface 501 in a dermal layer 503, a fat layer 505, a superficial muscular aponeurotic system 507 (hereinafter “SMAS 507”), and a facial muscle layer 509. The combination of these layers in total may be known as subcutaneous tissue 510. Also illustrated in FIG. 14 is a treatment zone 525 which is below the surface 501. In one embodiment, the surface 501 can be a surface of the skin of a subject 500. Although the term facial muscle may be used herein as an example, the inventors have contemplated application of the device to any tissue in the body. In various embodiments, the device and/or methods may be used on muscles (or other tissue) of the face, neck, head, arms, legs, or any other location in the body.
    Facial muscle tissue is capable of contraction and expansion. Skeletal muscle is a fibrous tissue used to generate stress and strain. For example, skeletal muscles in the forehead region can produce frowning and wrinkles. There are several facial muscles within the brow or forehead including the epicranius muscle, the corrugator supercilii muscle, and the procerus muscle. These facial muscles are responsible for movement of the forehead and various facial expressions. Besides facial muscles, other tissues exist in the brow region that also can lead to wrinkles on the brow.
    In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, methods for ultrasound cosmetic treatment of tissue using one cosmetic treatment system are provided. The ultrasound energy can be focused, unfocused or defocused and is applied to a ROI 65 containing one of facial muscle tissue or dermal layers or fascia to achieve a therapeutic effect, such as a tighten of a brow of a subject 500.
    In various embodiments, certain cosmetic procedures that are traditionally performed through invasive techniques are accomplished by targeting energy such as ultrasound energy at specific subcutaneous tissues 510. In one embodiment, methods for non-invasively treating subcutaneous tissues 510 to perform a brow life are provided. In one embodiment, a non-invasive brow lift is performed by applying ultrasound energy at specific depths 278 along the brow to ablatively cut, cause tissue to be reabsorbed into the body, coagulate, remove, manipulate, or paralyze subcutaneous tissue 510 such as the facial muscle 509, for example, the corrugator supercilii muscle, the epicranius muscle, and the procerus muscle within the brow to reduce wrinkles.
    In some embodiments, ultrasound energy is applied at a ROI 65 along a patient's forehead. The ultrasound energy can be applied at specific depths and is capable of targeting certain subcutaneous tissues within the brow such as with reference to FIGS. 12-14, SMAS 507 and/or facial muscle 509. The ultrasound energy targets these tissues and cuts, ablates, coagulates, micro-ablates, manipulates and/or causes the subcutaneous tissue 510 to be reabsorbed into the subject's body which effectuates a brow lift non-invasively.
    For example, the corrugator supercilii muscle in a target zone 525, can be targeted and treated by the application of ultrasound energy at specific depths 278. This facial muscle 509 or other subcutaneous facial muscles can be ablated, coagulated, micro-ablated, shaped or otherwise manipulated by the application of ultrasound energy in a non-invasive manner. Specifically, instead of cutting a corrugator supercilii muscle during a classic or endoscopic brow lift, the targeted muscle 509 such as the corrugator supercilii can be ablated, micro-ablated, or coagulated by applying ultrasound energy at the forehead without the need for traditional invasive techniques.
    One method is configured for targeted treatment of subcutaneous tissue 510 in the forehead region 65 in various manners such as through the use of therapy only, therapy and monitoring, imaging and therapy, or therapy, imaging and monitoring. Targeted therapy of tissue can be provided through ultrasound energy delivered at desired depths 278 and locations via various spatial and temporal energy settings. In one embodiment, the tissues of interest are viewed in motion in real time by utilizing ultrasound imaging to clearly view the moving tissue to aid in targeting and treatment of a ROI 65 on the patient's forehead. Therefore, the practitioner or user performing the non-invasive brow lift can visually observe the movement and changes occurring to the subcutaneous tissue 510 during treatment.
     FIGS. 15-17 illustrate an embodiment of a method of administering a brow lift. Other embodiments include multiple treatment depths, three dimensional (3-D) treatment, and use of multiple treatment sessions over time. The CTS 20 can be coupled to a tissue portion 10 of the ROI 65 that is to be treated. In one embodiment, a treatment zone 525 is first imaged and then treated. In one embodiment, a user activates the imaging button 150 to initiate the imaging sequence. Imaging can be displayed on the graphical interface 310. In one embodiment, the imaging sequence can be controlled on a touchscreen 315 that is part of the graphical interface 310. After the imaging sequence is started, the treatment sequence can be initiated at any time. The user can activate treatment button 160 at any time to initiate the treatment sequence. Treatment and imaging can occur simultaneously or occur sequentially. For example, a user can image, treat, image, treat, etc. As schematically illustrated in FIG. 15, the treatment sequence activates the treatment portion of the transducer 280 to create voids or lesions 550 below the surface 105. Note that FIG. 15 illustrates one embodiment of a depth 278 that corresponds to a muscle depth. In various embodiments, the depth 278 can correspond to any tissue, tissue layer, skin, dermis, fat, SMAS, muscle, or other tissue. Note that as illustrated, the energy 50 represented is for illustration purposes only. Certain figures including FIGS. 15-17 show energy 50 emanating from the entire length of the transducer housing (its entire opening such as corresponding to travel distance 272); however the actual energy is emitted from a sub-length of that, e.g., the actual transduction element of the transducer 280. In one embodiment, the transduction element of the transducer 280 is scanned in a linear motion to cover the region of interest, such that at any time the energy is not coming out of the entire transducer housing's length at once.
    In one embodiment, CTS 20 generates ultrasound energy which is directed to and focused below the surface 501. This controlled and focused ultrasound energy creates the lesion 550 which may be a thermally coagulated zone or void in subcutaneous tissue 510. In one embodiment, the emitted energy 50 raises a temperature of the tissue at a specified depth 278 below the surface 501. The temperature of the tissue can be raised from about 1° C. to about 100° C. above an ambient temperature of the tissue, or about 5° C. to about 60° C. above an ambient temperature of the tissue or above 10° C. to about 50° C. above the ambient temperature of the tissue. In some embodiments, the emitted energy 50 targets the tissue below the surface 501 which cuts, ablates, coagulates, micro-ablates, manipulates, and/or causes a lesion 550 in the tissue portion 10 below the surface 501 at a specified depth 278. In one embodiment, during the treatment sequence, the transducer 280 moves in a direction denoted by the arrow marked 290 at specified intervals 295 to create a series of treatment zones 254 each of which receives an emitted energy 50 to create a lesion 550. For example, the emitted energy 50 creates a series of lesions 550 in the facial muscle layer 509 of tissue portion 10.
    In various embodiments, delivery of emitted energy 50 at a suitable depth 278, distribution, timing, and energy level is provided by the emitter-receiver module 200 through controlled operation by the control system 300 to achieve the desired therapeutic effect of controlled thermal injury to treat at least one of the dermis layer 503, fat layer 505, the SMAS layer 507 and the facial muscle layer 509. During operation, the emitter-receiver module 200 and/or the transducer 280 can also be mechanically and/or electronically scanned along the surface 501 to treat an extended area. In addition, spatial control of a treatment depth 278 can be suitably adjusted in various ranges, such as between a wide range of about 0 mm to about 25 mm, suitably fixed to a few discrete depths, with an adjustment limited to a fine range, for example, approximately between about 3 mm to about 9 mm, and/or dynamically adjusted during treatment, to treat at least one of the dermis layer 503, fat layer 505, the SMAS layer 507 and the facial muscle layer 509. Before, during, and after the delivery of ultrasound energy 50 to at least one of the dermis layer 503, fat layer 505, the SMAS layer 507 and the facial muscle layer 509, monitoring of the treatment area and surrounding structures can be provided to plan and assess the results and/or provide feedback to the controller 300 and the user via the graphical interface 310.
    As to the treatment of the SMAS layer 507 and similar fascia, connective tissue can be permanently tightened by thermal treatment to temperatures about 60° C. or higher. Upon ablating, collagen fibers shrink immediately by approximately 30% of their length. The shrunken fibers can produce tightening of the tissue, wherein the shrinkage should occur along the dominant direction of the collagen fibers. Throughout the body, collagen fibers are laid down in connective tissues along the lines of chronic stress (tension). On the aged face, the collagen fibers of the SMAS 507 region are predominantly oriented along the lines of gravitational tension. Shrinkage of these fibers results in tightening of the SMAS 507 in the direction desired for correction of laxity and sagging due to aging. The treatment includes the ablation of specific regions of the SMAS 507 region and similar suspensory connective tissues.
    In addition, the SMAS layer 507 varies in depth and thickness at different locations, for example from about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm or more. On the face, important structures such as nerves, parotid gland, arteries and veins are present over, under or near the SMAS 507 region. Treating through localized heating of regions of the SMAS 507 layer or other suspensory subcutaneous tissue 510 to temperatures of about 60° C. to about 90° C., without significant damage to overlying or distal/underlying tissue, or proximal tissue, as well as the precise delivery of therapeutic energy to the SMAS layer 507, and obtaining feedback from the region of interest before, during, and after treatment can be suitably accomplished through the CTS 20.
    In various embodiments, a method is provided for performing a brow lift on a patient. In some embodiments, the method includes coupling a probe 200 to a brow region 65 of the patient 60 and imaging at least a portion of subcutaneous tissue 510 of the brow region to determine a target area in the subcutaneous tissue 510. In an aspect of the embodiment, the method includes administering ultrasound energy 50 into the target area 525 in the subcutaneous tissue 510 to ablate the subcutaneous tissue 510 in the target area 525, which causes tightening of a dermal layer 503 above the subcutaneous tissue 510 of the brow region 65.
    In various embodiments, a method is provided for tightening a portion of a dermal layer 503 on a facial area of a patient 60. In some embodiments, the method includes inserting a transducer module 200 into a band controller 100 and then coupling the transducer module 200 to a facial area of the patient 60. In one embodiment, the method includes activating a first switch 150 on the hand controller 100 to initiate an imaging sequence of a portion of tissue 10 below the dermal layer 503, then collecting data from the imaging sequence. In this embodiment, the method includes calculating a treatment sequence from the collected data, and activating a second switch 160 on the hand controller 100 to initiate the treatment sequence. In an aspect of the embodiments, the method can be useful on a portion of a face, head, neck and/or other part of the body of a patient 60.
    With reference to FIG. 16, after the emitted energy has created lesions 550, healing and/or tightening of the portion of tissue 10 begins. In one embodiment, the void or lesion 550 can dissipate in the facial muscle layer 509 of the portion of tissue 10. For example, the facial muscle layer 509 has movement 560 around the lesion 550 to shrink the lesion 550. Eventually, the body essentially eliminates the lesion 550 through resorption, and can enhance the growth of tissue. This movement 560 causes upper layers such as the SMAS 507 to have movement 570 above where the lesion 550 was located. This in turn causes movement 580 at the surface 501 which tightens surface 501. This surface movement 580 at the surface 501 is the goal of any brow lift. The surface movement 580 creates a tightening effect across the skin surface 501 which can provide a more youthful look for the subject 500. In various embodiments, a medicant can be applied during the coupling of the CTS 20 to the portion of tissue 10. This medicant can be activated in the target zone 525 by the emitted energy 50 and can assist, accelerate, and/or treat the void or lesion 550 during the dissipation and/or healing of the void or lesion 550. Medicants include, but are not limited to, hyaluronic acid, retinol, vitamins (e.g., vitamin c), minerals (e.g., copper) and other compounds or pharmaceuticals that can be activated by energy and/or would benefit from deeper penetration into the skin.
    Turning to FIG. 18, a flow chart illustrates a method according to various embodiments of the present invention. A method 800 can include a first step 801 which is a coupling of a probe to a brow region. For example, step 801 can include the coupling of the emitter-receiver module 200 to a portion of tissue 10 in a ROI 65 of the subject 500. This step 801 can include a gel located between the emitter-receiver module 200 and the portion of tissue 10 that assists in the coupling of a probe to the brow region. Step 801 can move to step 802 which is imaging subcutaneous tissue 510 in the brow region. Step 802 can include imaging the portion of tissue 10 using the CTS 20 as discussed herein. Optionally, a step 810 can be included between steps 801 and 802. Step 810 is the applying a medicant to the brow region. The medicant can be any substance or material that has an active ingredient that may be helpful in the tightening of the surface 501 and/or in the healing and/or dissipation of the void or lesion 550 in a portion of tissue 10 below the surface 501. In one embodiment, the medicant can also act as a coupling gel useful in step 801. Step 802 moves to step 803 which is determining a target zone 525. Step 803 can include reviewing an image that was created in step 802 to help determine the target zone 525.
    Step 803 moves to step 804 which is the administering of energy to the target zone 525. For example, step 804 can be illustrated in, for example, FIG. 15. Note that FIG. 15 illustrates one embodiment of a depth 278 that corresponds to a muscle depth. In various embodiments, the depth 278 can correspond to any tissue, tissue layer, skin, dermis, fat, SMAS, muscle, or other tissue. Step 804 moves to step 805 which is ablating the tissue in the target zone 525. In various embodiments, this “ablating” may be coagulation instead of ablation. Ablation is more or less instantaneous physical removal, analogous to sublimation or vaporization, while thermal coagulation is milder in that it is killing tissue but leaving it in place. Step 805 is illustrated in FIG. 15. Note that FIG. 15 illustrates one embodiment of a depth 278 that corresponds to a muscle depth. In various embodiments, the depth 278 can correspond to any tissue, tissue layer, skin, dermis, fat, SMAS, muscle, or other tissue. In step 805, the void or lesion 550 is created in a portion of tissue 10 below the surface 501. Step 805 moves to step 806 which is tightening a dermal layer 503 above or below the treated tissue. In the illustrated embodiment, step 806 is merely tightening a dermal layer above the tissue, but the broader step described is possible in various embodiments. Step 806 is illustrated in FIG. 17. For example, one of the surface 501 in the dermal layer 503 is tightened due to the void or lesion 505 being dissipated or healed. Between step 505 and 506, an optional step 812 may be used. Typically, for step 812 to be used, optional step 810 must also be used. In step 812, the medicant is activated in the target zone 525. This activation of the medicant can allow active ingredient to assist in tightening the dermal layer 503 above the ablate tissue. For example, the active ingredient may assist in the healing or dissipating of the void or lesion 550. In another example, the medicant may be activated at the surface 501 or in the dermal layer 503 to assist tightening.
    With reference to FIG. 19 a method 900 is illustrated according to various embodiments of the present invention. Method 900 begins with inserting a transducer module to the hand controller. For example, method 900 can include the inserting of the emitter-receiver module 200 into the hand wand 100. Step 901 moves to step 902 which is the coupling of the module to a facial area of the subject. For example, step 902 can include coupling the emitter-receiver module 200 to a region of interest 65 of a subject 63. Step 902 moves to step 903 which is activating a first switch on the hand controller. For example, step 903 can include activating an imaging button 150 on the hand wand 100. Step 903 moves to step 904 which is initiating the imaging sequence. For example, step 904 can include imaging sequence that can be collected by the CTS 20 as discussed herein. Step 904 moves to step 905 which is collecting imaging data. Step 905 moves to step 906 which is calculating a treatment sequence. In various embodiments, “calculating” as used with respect to step 906 can be determining, selecting, selecting a predetermined treatment sequence, and/or selecting a desired treatment sequence. For example, step 906 can include the controller 300 downloading a treatment sequence to the hand wand 100 and the emitter-receiver module 200. Step 906 moves to step 907 which is the activating of a second switch on the hand controller. For example, step 907 can be the activating of the treatment button 160 on the hand wand 100. Step 907 moves to step 908 which is executing the treatment sequence. For example, step 908 can be any treatment sequence as discussed herein. In other embodiments, the illustrated method may be broader to include generalized activating of switches anywhere and anyhow, such as with foot switches or switches on the controller 300, in various non-limiting embodiments.
     FIGS. 20-21 illustrate a front and side view of one embodiment of a controller 300 as previously described herein. FIG. 22 illustrates one embodiment of an interactive graphical display 310, which can include a touch screen monitor and Graphic User Interface (GUI) that allows the user to interact with the CTS 20. FIG. 22 illustrates a general example of an embodiment of an interactive graphical display 310, which may include system function tabs 1000, therapy controls 1010, imaging controls 1020, region control 1030, patient total line count 1040, treat zone line count 1050, system status 1060, probe information area 1070, header information 1080 and/or image-treat region 1090.
    The system function tabs 1000 reflect aspects of the system function. In one embodiment, the interactive graphical display 310 has one or more general functions. In various embodiments the interactive graphical display 310 has two, three, four or more general functions. In one embodiment, an interactive graphical display 310 has three general functions: a planning function, a imaging/treatment function, and a settings function. In one embodiment, the planning function contains the controls and information instrumental in planning a treatment, which can automatically set therapy controls. In one embodiment, the planning function can display an overview of the various treatment regions with recommended treatment parameters for each. For example, parameters for treating such regions as the forehead, left or right temple, left or right preauricular, left or right neck, submental, and left or right cheek can show a recommended emitter-receiver module 200 listing energy levels and recommended numbers of lines of treatment. Certain areas can include a protocol listing for selection of treatment protocols, a protocol allowed treat regions listing, and disallowed regions that can not be selected due to an incorrect transducer, which can be grayed out. In one embodiment, the imaging/treatment function contains the controls and protocol information needed for imaging soft tissue and for treating pertinent soft tissue. In various embodiments, a start up screen can include patient and/or facility data. In one embodiment the imaging/treatment function can include a main startup screen. In one embodiment a imaging/treatment function can be configured for a forehead. The settings function allows the user to input, track, store and/or print patient treatment information outside the scanning function, and can include such information as patient and facility information, end treatment, treatment records, images, help, volume, and system shutdown controls and dialogs.
    The therapy controls 1010 can set acoustic energy level, spacing for setting the distance between micro-coagulative zones, and length which can set the maximum distance of the treatment line and similar information.
    The imaging controls 1020 can include marker (not scanning), display (scanning), image and scan information. The marker can include a distance icon to show calipers and text for annotation. The display can increase or decrease brightness or other display related characteristics. The image icon can toggle a treat ruler, or save an image. The scan buttons can start or stop scanning for imaging purposes and similar information.
    The region control 1030 launches a dialog below the image to select tissue region. The patient total line count 1040 keeps track of the cumulative number of treatment lines delivered and similar information. The treat zone line count 1050 indicates a zone of treatment, such as forehead or submental, etc. and can display the lines delivered to a zone or a protocol for recommended lines and similar information. The system status 1060 can display that the system is ready, treating, or other mode-dependent system messages and similar information. The probe information area 1070 can display the name of the attached transducer, the treatment depth of the transducer, and the number of lines spent/(vs.) total line capacity of transducer and similar information. The header information 1080 can include the facility, clinician, patient name and patient identification, date and time and similar information. The image-treat region 1090 can include an ultrasound image, horizontal and vertical (depth) rulers with 1 mm tick marks or other measuring dimensions, a treatment ruler indicating spacing, length and depth of treatment, and other similar information.
    One benefit or advantage of using a treatment system that also allows imaging is that a user can verify that there sufficient coupling between the transducer and the skin (such as by applying coupling gel between the emitter-receiver module 200 and skin) by ensuring there are not dark, vertical bars, as indicative of air pockets between the face of the transducer and patient. A lack of coupling may result in a region that is improperly treated. Corrective action might include placing more coupling ultrasound gel to ensure proper contact and communication between the device and the patient.
    Therapeutic treatment can be initiated by pressing the treatment button 160 on the hand wand 100. In one embodiment, an indicator 155 will display a yellow light to indicate the system is in the “treating” state. As the energy 50 is delivered a continuous tone is sounded and a yellow ‘treating’ line will advance over the green ‘ready’ treatment line on the screen. To deliver the next line of energy in the same treatment area, the user can advance the transducer roughly 1-6 mm, or roughly 2-3 mm (depending on the treatment, region, etc.) to adjacent tissue and press the treatment button 160 again. In various embodiments, a time period can elapse between delivering a previous line of energy 50. In various embodiments, the time period can be 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or any other duration. In one embodiment, if five or ten seconds (or some other duration) have elapsed between delivering the previous line of energy 50, the user can press the imaging button 150 on the hand wand 100 to restore the “ready” state, and then press the treatment button 160 next to it. Treatment can continue in this fashion until the recommended number of lines (as shown on the bottom/center of the screen) has been delivered. In one embodiment, when the correct number of lines is delivered, the line count color turns from orange to white.
    In one embodiment, the settings function allows a user to export images. Stored images are listed in the bottom dialog box and the most recently user-selected image is displayed above it. If an external storage device and/or printer is attached then image file export and/or printing is enabled, respectively. In one embodiment, the settings function allows a user to export records.
    In certain embodiments, the interactive graphical display 310 can display error messages to direct appropriate user responses, such as in one embodiment of an error message.

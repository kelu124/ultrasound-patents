It should be appreciated that such components and steps may be realized by any number of hardware components configured to perform the specified functions. For example, various embodiments may employ various medical treatment devices, visual imaging and display devices, input terminals and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more control systems or other control devices. In addition, the embodiments may be practiced in any number of medical contexts and that the various embodiments relating to a method and system for acoustic tissue treatment as described herein are merely indicative of exemplary applications for the invention. For example, the principles, features and methods discussed may be applied to any medical application.
Now with reference to FIGS. 1-2, a cylindrically-focused transducer 100 is illustrated. In accordance to various embodiments, cylinder transducer 100 can comprise a ground 110, a thick film 112, an electrode 114, and a backing material 115. Cylinder transducer 100 can have various dimensions, which can include length 122, width 127, and thickness 125. In addition, cylindrically-focused transducer 100 can have dimensions, which can include radius of curvature 121, elevation 123, ground length 124, and electrode length 126.
As illustrated in FIG. 2, cylindrically-focused transducer 100 comprises thick film 112, which is sandwiched between electrode 114 and ground 110. Electrode 114 is attached to backing 115. In various embodiments, thick film 114 is a piezo-electric material. A method of making cylindrically-focused transducer 100 can comprise the steps of attaching electrode 114 to backing material 115, coating electrode 114 with thick film 112, and placing ground 110 in contact with thick film 112.
In various embodiments, the fabrication and performance of a high frequency single element transducer uses a new integrated multilayer structure where a thick film is directly deposited on a spherical curved substrate by a pad-printing process. The addition of acoustical lens is then avoided. For example, a commercial porous PZT can be used as the transducer backing due to its scattering and lossy nature. By taking into account the conditions required for the fabrication process (such as high temperature for the sintering of the piezo-electric film) and acoustical properties of a standard backing for medical imaging, a porous PZT element can be used.
EXAMPLE 1
For example, cylindrically-focused transducer 100 can be fabricated using the following steps. Backing material 115 can be made from a block, for example a block of porous PZT, which can be machined to the specified dimensions. A lens shaped depression can be machined into one of the faces of the block, which can have the dimensions of radius of curvature 121, elevation 123, and length 122. A smoothing layer can be printed into the lens shaped depression. Using a pad printing technique, electrode 114 can be placed into lens shaped depression. Thick film 112 can be a PZT paste, such as, for example, composition TF2100 which is a hard-doped ceramic NAVY type I (Ferroperm Pz26) with a sintering aid, milled to a tine grain size, and which can be mixed with an organic solvent. Thick film 112 can be pad printed onto electrode 114. Ground 110 can be pad printed onto thick film 112.

In various embodiments, a transducer array 101 is illustrated in FIGS. 3-7. In various embodiments, transducer array 101 can be fabricated from cylindrically-focused transducer 100. In various embodiments, the next step in the process of fabrication is to form acoustically and electrically isolated elements 130 of transducer array 101. For example, a cutting means such as use of a dicing saw, a laser, or etching, can be used on cylindrically-focused transducer 100 to form acoustically and electrically isolated elements 130. Since electrode length 126 is shorter than ground length 124, when cylindrically-focused transducer 100 is diced deep enough to depth 140, individual elements 130 can be electrically formed and the dicing kerf 136 can isolate the elements mechanically to reduce crosstalk. In one embodiment, a shallow mechanical isolation can be done with one method and a different electric isolation can be done by electrically isolating along the sides of transducer array 101 with a different method and/or effective depths.
In various embodiments, interconnect 135 is provided to extend the individual elements 130 of transduce array 101 through electrical coupling means 142 towards imaging electronics (not illustrated). For example, interconnect 135 can be an anisotropic interconnect, which conducts only along one axis, for example along the thickness, can be coupled to a plurality of electrodes 114 of transducer array 101. In one embodiment, a printed circuit of electrically conducting fingers connect interconnect 135 to the array elements 130. Interconnect 135 can include an adhesive which can bond to the printed circuit. Interconnect 135 can include electrical coupling means 142, such as, for example, solder, conductive epoxy, anisotropic adhesive, wire bonds, or other means, which can bond to the printed circuit. In one embodiment, a flexible printed circuit can be coupled to the elements 130 and connected to backing material 115. In some embodiments, cylindrically focused transducer 100 is mated to interconnect 135 via electrical coupling means 142 before dicing kerfs 136. In some embodiments, after interconnect 135 is coupled, the whole transducer array 101 can be coated or potted in one or more layers to provide mechanical and electric isolation and/or to form matching layers and/or lenses.
In another embodiment, electrodes 114 can be fabricated atop the backing material 115 as distinct, electrically-isolated conductive strips. For example, electrode 114 can be plated whole and then laser isolated or cut to produce a plurality of electrodes 114. For example, backing material 115 can be plated whole and then the fingers can be deposited as distinct conductive strips to produce a plurality of electrodes 114, including electrode length 126. In one embodiment, PZT thick film 112 can be placed on to the fingers, and then a contiguous top conductive ground 110 layers can be placed in to the PZT thick film 112, which is common to all the elements. The PZT in an aspect of this embodiment the PZT thick film 112 is highly anisotropic, such that in the thickness vibrational direction there is a large degree of electromechanical coupling, but much less in the lateral direction. In such a case it may be possible to achieve suitable performance without physical mechanical isolation such as cutting. No pillars are needed to isolate elements 130 of transducer array 101. In some embodiments, a plurality of equally spaced can be cuts into the depression and perpendicular to the length of the array 101. The plurality of equally spaced cuts can isolate each element 130 of the transducer array in at least one of electrically and mechanically. Isolated elements 130 or transduction elements can be created between the cuts. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of equally spaced cuts is deeper than a length of the electrode 114 and is shorter than a length of the ground 110.
In some embodiments, array 101 can be combined with another transducer, such as, for example, a second transducer array or a single element transducer. For example, a slot can be created or etched into the center of the single element transducer and array 101 can be affixed into the slot. In some examples the array 101 can be coupled to imaging electronics. In one example, an image can be displayed from the array 101 and ultrasound therapy can be delivered from the single element transducer.
In embodiments having a thin backing material 115, thick film 112 can be shaped into curved convex and concave arrays, and transducers with spherical or cylindrical foci can be formed as well. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional arrays can be fabricated based on using one or more sub-arrays.
In various embodiments, transducer array 101 has capability to form high- to extremely-high frequency arrays. In one embodiment, transducer array 101 can have a frequency range of about 2 MHz to about 20 MHz. In one embodiment, transducer array 101 can have a frequency range of about 20 MHz to about 60 MHz. In one embodiment, transducer array 101 can have a frequency range of about 50 MHz to about 100 MHz. In one embodiment, transducer array 101 can have a frequency range of about 10 MHz to about 30 MHz. In one embodiment, transducer array 101 can have a frequency range of above 20 MHz. In some embodiments, an acoustical matching layer can be coated over elements 130 of transducer array 101. In one embodiment, an acoustical matching layer can be quarter wavelength thick, which can amplify acoustic wave transmission and place the amplified acoustic wave in phase.
In one embodiment, transducer array 101 can be placed in a liquid-filled housing or other spatial standoff or half-space proximal to a region of interest (not illustrated). The distance of transducer array 101 from the region of interest is set so the resulting image in the region of interest does not have reverberation artifacts. This can be achieved by making the length of the standoff equal to or about the viewing depth, if the speeds of sound in the region-of-interest is approximately equal to the speed of sound in the standoff. To avoid this limit, in one embodiment of using the thick film array the time-of-flight is extended by the use of materials with low phase velocity compared to the region-of-interest. This magnifies the reverberation free image depth in the region of interest.
With reference to FIG. 6, transducer array 101 is illustrated with the location of electrode 114 and ground 110 reversed in relation to thick film 112. In some embodiments, ground 110 is attached to backing 115. In various embodiments, thick film 114 is a piezo-electric material, which is printed onto ground 110 and electrode 114 is printed onto thick film 112. A method of making transducer array 101 can comprise the steps of attaching ground 110 to backing material 115, coating ground 110 with thick film 112, and placing electrode 114 in contact with thick film 112. The method can include the steps of forming acoustically and electrically isolated elements 130 of transducer array 101, which can include creating kerf 136 between the elements 130 of transducer array 101. Since electrode length 126 is shorter than ground length 124, when transducer 101 is diced deep enough, individual elements 130 can be electrically formed and the dicing kerf 136 can isolate the elements mechanically to reduce crosstalk. In some embodiments, ground electrode length 124 can be diced through and then reconnected, as desired via electrical coupling means 142. In some embodiments, array elements 130 can be poled or re-poled after fabrication of transducer 100.

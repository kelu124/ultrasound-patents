CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
The present application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. provisional application No. 61/481,357 filed 2 May 2011 entitled “Mechanically driven sonic toothbrush system,” which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to oral health products. More specifically, the present invention relates to sonic toothbrush systems.
BACKGROUND
The state of the art in sonic toothbrush technology centers around drive systems that create a desired oscillating toothbrush output motion by using electro-magnetic drivers and centering return springs to directly create oscillating motion. No continuous input rotation or drivers are involved in these electro-magnetic systems and such electro-magnetic systems have a relatively high production cost.
There are also currently many toothbrushes that provide oscillating output brush motion from continuously rotating input drivers. Such mechanically-driven toothbrushes typically have a reduced manufacturing cost as compared to toothbrushes employing electro-magnetic drivers. However, such rotating systems all perform the oscillating function at speeds well below sonic level. There are no continuously rotating input drive systems that operate at sonic speeds.
The information included in this Background section of the specification, including any references cited herein and any description or discussion thereof, is included for technical reference purposes only and is not to be regarded subject matter by which the scope of the invention as defined in the claims is to be bound.
SUMMARY
One exemplary implementation of a mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush includes an electric motor, a brush shaft, and a drive assembly. The electric motor may be a continuously rotating input driver (e.g., a DC motor) that drives a specifically balanced drive assembly with a linkage system to change the continuous rotation of the input driver into the desired oscillating output motion which drives the attached toothbrush head at a sonic speed(s). The electric motor includes a drive shaft. When the electric motor is actuated, the drive shaft continuously rotates until the motor is arrested. The drive assembly is coupled between the drive shaft and a brush shaft. The drive assembly is configured to convert the rotation of the drive shaft into sonic oscillation of a toothbrush supported on an end of the brush shaft.
In another implementation of the sonic toothbrush system, the drive assembly includes a coupler and an eccentric pin. The coupler has a first end and a second end. The first end is operably coupled to the brush shaft and the eccentric pin is rotationally received within the second end. The rotation of the drive shaft causes the eccentric pin to rotate within the second end. The rotation of the eccentric pin causes the coupler to oscillate.
In a further exemplary implementation, a sonic toothbrush may have an electric motor including a drive shaft, a brush shaft, and a drive assembly. When the electric motor is caused to operate, the drive shaft continuously rotates until the motor is caused to stop. The drive assembly may be coupled between the drive shaft and the brush shaft and configured to convert the rotation of the drive shaft into sonic oscillation of a toothbrush head supported on an end of the brush shaft.
In an additional exemplary implementation, a sonic toothbrush may provide oscillating bristle motion. The sonic toothbrush may include a continuously rotating drive system, a brush shaft, and a linkage between the drive system and the brush shaft that provides oscillating, sonic speed output motion to the brush shaft with an extremely low level of mechanical vibration and noise.
In yet another exemplary implementation, a method of designing a sonic toothbrush is disclosed. The sonic toothbrush may have a continuously rotating drive system, a brush shaft, and a linkage between the drive system and the brush shaft. The method may involve performing a finite element analysis on the linkage and then determining a weight distribution in the linkage based upon the finite element analysis to position a center of mass of the linkage and impart a balance or a selected imbalance to the linkage. The method may further involve adjusting one or more replaceable weights within the linkage to alter the center of mass or alter the selected imbalance.
This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. A more extensive presentation of features, details, utilities, and advantages of the present invention as defined in the claims is provided in the following written description of various embodiments of the invention and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Several exemplary embodiments of a mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush system are disclosed herein. The sonic toothbrush system makes use of a continuously rotating input driver (e.g., a DC or AC motor) that operates a balanced linkage system to change the continuous rotation of the input driver into a desired oscillating output motion, which drives the attached toothbrush head at a sonic speed or speeds.
The mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush system may have a lower production cost than the current electro-magnetic sonic toothbrush systems due to the use of DC drive motors for input drive motion and the use of relatively inexpensive molded plastic components. The mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush system, due in part to its balance weights, allows its mechanical drive to provide sonic output motion with a low level of vibration and noise. The weights (i.e., plugs or other components of a selected mass) can be tailored to produce these reduced vibration and noise levels at various output oscillation speeds, from sub-sonic through sonic. This tailored weight aspect of the mechanical drive allows a single basic system design to be used for a wide range of sub-sonic through sonic brush outputs and models by changing the balance components during brush manufacture.
Thus, the exemplary mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush systems disclosed herein may provide a continuously rotating input drive system that provides oscillating, sonic-speed toothbrush output motion with an extremely low level of mechanical vibration and noise. Also, the exemplary mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush systems disclosed herein provide a sonic toothbrush system at a reduced production cost.
The use of “sonic” or “sonic speed” herein refers to the frequency of oscillation of the brush head of the toothbrush and means that such frequency is within the range of sound frequencies (i.e., between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz). Typically, sonic toothbrushes operate at a range of between 200 and 300 cycles per second. In exemplary implementations of the disclosed mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush system disclosed herein, the motor may operate at between 200 and 300 rotations per second (i.e., between 12,000 and 18,000 rpm).
An exemplary embodiment of a mechanically-driven, sonic toothbrush system 10 disclosed herein is depicted in FIG. 1, which is a brush end isometric view of the system 10. As shown in FIG. 1, the system 10 includes a brush end 12, a base end 14 opposite the brush end, a housing 16 extending between the ends 12, 14 and forming the surface of the system 10, and a generally flat base 18 on which the system 10 may be stood upright on a planar surface, such as a countertop. A brush shaft 20 extends out of the housing 16 at the brush end 12 from the system drive assembly enclosed by the housing 16 and discussed below. A shaft seal 21 extends about the shaft 20 between the housing 16 and shaft 20 at the brush end 12 and is configured to allow the shaft 20 to oscillate while preventing the ingress of fluids into the interior of the housing.
The housing 16 may be generally cylindrically shaped to ergonomically fit in the hand of a user. The cylindrical shape may taper in the direction of the brush end 12 approximately one third the length of the housing 16 from the brush end 12. A control button 22 is supported on the housing 16 and actuates the system drive assembly between on and off and additionally, in some instances, between a range of speeds. A face plate 23 is supported on the housing 16 in a region extending about the control button 22. A toothbrush 25 (shown in phantom lines) is mounted on the end of the brush shaft 20. The toothbrush 25 includes a plurality of bristles 27.
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, which are, respectively, a side view and a bottom isometric view of the system 10 with the housing 16 removed, the system 10 includes an internal support structure formed by a chassis 24 extending towards the base end 14 and a drive bracket or chassis 26 extending towards the brush end 12. An induction coil 28 is wound around a bobbin and is located between the interior side of the flat base 18 and a base end 14 side of the chassis 24. A rechargeable battery pack 30 is electrically coupled to the induction coil 28 and supported in a pocket of the chassis 24 on a brush end 12 side of the charger coil 28.
As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, an electric DC motor 32 is supported off of the chassis 24 and drive bracket 26 near the overlap of these structures. The motor 32 is electrically coupled to the battery pack 30 via electrical control circuits 33 of a printed circuit board 34 supported off of the chassis 24 and drive bracket 26. The electrical control circuits 33 are actuated via the control button 22 to cause the motor 32 to operate at different states (e.g., on, off, high speed, low speed, etc.). In one embodiment, the electrical control circuits 33 controlling the motor 32 include one or more trim pots that allow precise control of frequency and motor speed.
As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5, which are, respectively, a top isometric view and a bottom isometric view of the drive bracket 26 and the components supported thereon, the system drive assembly 36 is supported within a pocket of the drive bracket 26. The drive assembly 36 mechanically couples the output shaft 37 of the motor 32 to the brush shaft 20 to cause the brush shaft 20 to oscillate at sonic speeds when the motor 32 causes its output shaft 37 to continuously rotate.
As illustrated in FIGS. 6, 7 and 10, which are, respectively, a top isometric view and first and second partially exploded views of the drive bracket 26 and the components supported thereon, the drive bracket 26 includes a front bearing ring 38 and a rear bearing ring 40. The rear bearing ring 40 may be multi-piece with a bearing bracket 41 forming the upper portion of the bearing ring 40 mounted to the drive bracket 26, which forms the lower portion of the rear bearing ring 40. The front bearing ring 38 includes a bushing or bearing 42, and the rear bearing ring 40 includes a bushing or bearing 44. The bearings 42, 44 may be ball or roller type bearings in some embodiments. The bearing 44 of the rear bearing ring 40 supports the rear end of the brush shaft 20, and the bearing ring 42 of the front bearing ring 38 supports the brush shaft 20 near the midpoint of the brush shaft 20.
As can be understood from a comparison of FIGS. 4 and 5 to FIG. 6, an isolator damper 46 extends about the front bearing ring 38 and acts to vibrationally isolate the moving components of the system 10 from the housing 16 that surrounds the damper 46 and moving components of the system 10.
As shown in FIG. 8, which is a front isometric view of the brush shaft 20, the drive assembly 36 and the motor 32 are mechanically coupled together for operation. The bearings 42, 44 support the shaft 20 and the rear end of the shaft 20 is received in a rocker arm 48 forming a front end of the drive assembly 36. Also, the motor output shaft 37 extends into a motor crank arm 50 forming a rear end of the drive assembly 36. The motor crank arm 50 is coupled to the rocker arm 48 via a dog bone coupler 52. An eccentric pin 53 extends from the motor crank arm 50 and through a lower portion of the coupler 52 to be received in a support bushing 54. The eccentric pin 53 acts as a cam and causes the lower portion of the coupler 52 to revolve about the axis of the motor shaft 37.
As indicated in FIG. 9, which is the same view as FIG. 8, with the motor 32, the rear bearing 44, and the bushing 54 removed, the front end of the brush shaft 20 is configured to engage with a brush head (not shown). For example, the brush shaft 20 may include a flat region 56 at its front end. The rear end of the brush shaft 20 is configured to engage 48 with the rocker arm 48. For example, the brush shaft 20 may include a flat region 58 at its rear end.
As shown in FIG. 10, which is an exploded isometric view of the drive assembly 36 and the shaft 10, the motor crank arm 50 includes balance weights 60 that are fixedly received in apertures 61 in the motor crank arm 50, as indicated by dashed lines identified at A and A′. Similarly, the rocker arm 48 includes a balance weight 62 that is fixedly received in an aperture 63 in the rocker arm 48, as indicated by the dashed line identified at B. The weights 60, 62 may act to counterbalance the components of the drive assembly 36 on which the weights 60, 62 are mounted to reduce noise and vibration in the drive assembly 36.
As illustrated in FIG. 10, a rearward end 53′ of the eccentric pin 53 is fixedly received in the motor crank arm 50, as indicated by the dashed line identified at C. An enlarged diameter eccentric mid portion 53″ of the eccentric pin 53 is rotationally received in a bearing 66, which is fixedly received in a lower aperture 65 of the dog bone coupler 52, and the forward end 53′″ of the eccentric pin 53 is rotationally received in the bushing 54. All of this indicated by the dashed line identified at D. The pivot pin 67 of the rocker arm 48 is pivotally or oscillatingly received in a bearing 68, which is fixedly received in an upper aperture 69 of the dog bone coupler 52, as indicated by the dashed line identified at E. Finally, as explained above, the brush shaft 20 is pivotally or oscillatingly located within the bearings 42, 44, and the rearward end of the shaft 20 is fixedly received in an aperture 70 the rocker arm 48, all of this indicated by the dashed line identified at F.
For a discussion of the features of some of the main components of the drive assembly 36, reference is made to FIGS. 11, 12 and 13. FIG. 11 is an exploded, front isometric view of the main components of the drive assembly 36. FIG. 12 is an exploded, side isometric view of the main components of the drive assembly 36. FIG. 13 is an exploded, rear isometric view of the main components of the drive assembly 36. As illustrated in FIGS. 11, 12 and 13, the motor crank arm 50 includes a central axis aperture 71, a dual lobe portion 72, a cylindrical portion 74, a conical portion 76, and apertures 61 for receiving the balance weights 60. The lobe portion 72 has a small lobe 78 and a large lobe 80 opposite the central axis aperture 71 from the small lobe 78. The lobes 78, 80 each include a weight-receiving aperture 61, generally centered in the respective lobe 78, 80. The cylindrical portion 74 extends rearward of the lobe portion 72 and the conical portion 76 extends forward of the lobe portion 72. The central axis aperture 71 extends rearward to forward through the motor crank arm 50, starting at the most rearward face of the cylindrical portion 74 and ending at the most forward face of the conical portion 76. The central axis aperture 71 is generally coaxial with the axis of the cylindrical portion 74.
As depicted in FIGS. 11, 12 and 13, the rocker arm 48 includes a lobed portion 82, a cylindrical portion 84, and a central axis aperture 70. The cylindrical portion 84 extends forwardly from the lobed portion 82. The central axis aperture 70 is generally coaxial with the axis of the cylindrical portion 84 and is shaped to fixedly engage the rearward end of the brush shaft 20, for example, the central axis aperture 70 may have a flat region 88 to correspond to the flat region 58 of the brush shaft and may further have a slot or keyway 89 to provide an additional engagement feature). The lobed portion 82 includes a tapered lobe 90 and a rounded lobe 92 opposite the central axis aperture 61 from the tapered lobe 90. The tapered lobe 90 includes a pivot pin 67 extending rearward from the tapered lobe 90 and having an axis generally parallel to the axis of the central axis aperture 70. The rounded lobe 92 includes a weighted region 94 of increased thickness extending rearward from the rounded lobe 92 and having the aperture 63 for receiving the weight 62.
As indicated in FIGS. 11, 12 and 13, the eccentric pin 53 includes a rearward end shaft 53′, an enlarged diameter eccentric mid portion 53″, and a forward end shaft 53′″. The rearward end shaft 53′ extends rearward from the mid portion 53″, and the forward end shaft 53′″ extends forward from the mid portion 53″. As can be understood from FIGS. 11, 12 and 13, the rearward end shaft 53′ and the forward end shaft 53″ share a common pivot axis, while the enlarged eccentric mid portion 53″ is eccentric relative to the forward and rearward end shafts 53′, 53′″ and has a pivot axis offset, but parallel to, the common pivot axis of the forward and rearward end shafts 53′, 53′″.
As shown in FIGS. 11, 12 and 13, the dog bone coupler 52 may have an hourglass shape and include a first rounded end portion 96 (motor crank arm engaging portion) extending into a reduced diameter mid portion 98 that extends into a second rounded end portion 100 (rocker arm engaging portion). The first end portion 96 includes an aperture 65 that receives the conical portion 76 of the motor crank arm 50 and the eccentric pin 53. The second end portion 100 includes an aperture 69 that receives the pivot pin 67 of the rocker arm 48. In one embodiment, the bearing 66 used in the dog bone coupler 52 is a model R 133ZZS and the bearing 44 utilized for the output brush shaft 20 is a model MR 104ZZ ball bearing.
For a discussion of the operation of the drive assembly 36, wherein continuous rotation of the motor drive shaft 37 in a single rotational direction results in the drive assembly 36 causing the brush shaft 20 to oscillate back and forth, reference is made to FIGS. 8, 14 and 15. FIG. 14 is generally the same isometric view of the motor 32, drive assembly 36 and brush shaft 20 as depicted in FIG. 8, except a cross section is shown extending through the axis of the motor drive shaft 37 and the eccentric pin 53. FIG. 15 is generally the same isometric view of the motor 32, drive assembly 36, and brush shaft 20 as depicted in FIG. 8, except a cross section extending through the axis of the pivot pin 67 of the rocker arm 48 is shown.
As can be understood from FIGS. 8 and 14, once the motor 32 is actuated by the control button 22 to turn on and run, the motor drive shaft 37, which is fixedly received in the central axis aperture 71 (see FIGS. 11-13) of the motor crank arm 50, rotates continuously in a single rotational direction until the control button 22 is turned to off to stop the motor 32. The rearward end shaft 53′ of the eccentric pin 53 is fixedly received in the central axis aperture 71 of the crank arm 50. The enlarged eccentric mid portion 53″ of the eccentric pin 53 is rotationally received within the bearing 66, which is fixedly received in the aperture 65 (see FIGS. 11-13) of the dog bone coupler 52. The forward end shaft 53′″ of the eccentric pin 53 is rotationally received in the bushing 54, which is mounterd in a fixed position on the drive bracket 26 as shown in FIG. 3. Thus, the rotating motor drive shaft 37 causes the motor crank arm 50 and eccentric pin 53 to rotate in the same direction. Thus, the enlarged eccentric mid portion 53″ and the forward end shaft 53′″ of the eccentric pin 53 rotate in the same direction, respectively, within the bearings 66, 54. The rotation of the enlarged eccentric mid portion 53″ causes the dog bone coupler 52 to move back and forth or, in other words, oscillate.
As can be understood from FIGS. 8, 14 and 15, the pivot pin 67 is pivotally or oscillatingly received in the bearing 68, which is fixedly received in the aperture 69 (see FIGS. 11-13) of the dog bone coupler 52. Thus, the back and forth or oscillating displacement of the dog bone coupler 52 causes the tapered lobe 90 to displace back and forth or oscillate about the axis of the central axis aperture 70 (see FIGS. 11-13) of the rocker arm 48. As a result, the rocker arm 48 and the brush shaft 20 are caused to pivot back and forth or oscillate about the longitudinal axis of the shaft 20.
As can be understood from the preceding discussion, in some embodiments, the drive assembly 36 used to convert the rotary motor motion into oscillating output brush shaft motion may be a four bar linkage. The required balance/imbalance of the various linkage components is related to the desired operational speed as well as the desired displacement of the oscillating output motion (i.e., different operational speeds and oscillating motion displacements employ different component balance/imbalance). In one embodiment, a design software program (e.g., finite element analysis software) may be used to calculate the desired center of mass locations of the various linkage components to minimize vibration and noise based on the desired design operational speed and displacement. The specific size and location of the balance/counterbalance weights 60, 62 for each component may then be finalized based on the mass of the material used for a component and the space constraints of the mechanism envelope in order to satisfy the desired resultant center of mass locations.
In exemplary embodiments, the motor drive shaft 50, dog bone coupler 52, rocker arm 48, and brush shaft 20 may be formed of a polymer material, while the weights 60, 62 may be formed of a metal material such as, for example, stainless steel, tungsten, etc. In other embodiments, the aforementioned drive assembly components and weights may be formed of other materials.

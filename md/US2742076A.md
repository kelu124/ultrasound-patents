METHOD OF STRETCHING TAPERED SHEETS Filed Jan. 28, 1952 2 Sheets-Sheet 2 /0 AWWIIIIII A WWII/1111110"- v I1g I. 
 IN V EN TOR. Azzzwz L 445/ ArrozA s 1 Ifhis iiivefifionrelates to the cold-levelling or stretchlevelliii'g of tafn'eredinembers such as tapered sheets, a s, extrusions'and other structural shapes. I I 
I 'otieration is usually performed on one tapered I r at a time in order primarily to restore the interna c iosssectinnal Tstressebhdition of the material to that pattern which it had before being rolled, forged extruded 6 her'wise workedihto thefstrticturalshape. The latter W fki ng s fared ce an unbannee or distorted grass-seetiofial stress hit'tern so configured that when the forged, eateries or "rolled fstruct nral shape is allowed to 561 Withdht 'c'ont'rdl jam; or in' or is machinegs'nrtaeed, it tends "to e/asp ilnder'this gross-sectional stress imbalance into "shafies so distorted that they eannothe'used. 
 The 'envehtionn st letchin g or such tapered mjefitbrs in order to restore the stress pattern to the desired configuration is notoriously unsatisfactory. For fine reason, the relativelyfthin edge of the single tapered member undergoing 'stretchingeanhot beheld o'r 'tensioned in an "subsi'sjtefit manner 'or by any hitherto known means that Will pr ev'eh tdahlage to the relatively Thin edge of the tapered memeert The clamping jaws or the feedefield f the stretch-levelling machine quite often break the thin. edge, war it, or otherwise so dama e it that the stretched, taper'e'd me mbe'r is unfit for use. When e'oncurfen'tly stretch l'evelling and stretch-contouring, it sometimes necessary, in order to assure theorete'n'tion 'of the contour, to apply fonningffor'c'es so far exceeding the elastic limit that the thin edge is almost invariably ruptured or'deformed so badly as to render the stretched and contoured memheruhusabl'e. I A 
 This invention broadly provides a method of levelling, stretching. ahd contouring tapered members which invriably produces a product in which the cross-sectional stress-pattern is of the optimum shape and configuration thus obviating Warping on subsequent machining or other Working; yet in which the relatively thin edge or edges remain intact in their original i'ectilin'ear, unbitolcen ahd unwarped condition. The method incidentally produces a balanced-stress tapered member which, in coopefat'ion with a suitable form, block or he like, may have ahd retain any desired "contour yet will not stretehed beyohli' its elastic limit. The method also provides a stretchl'evelled 'tztpefed me ber free of local surface irregulariti'es' s ueh as c0l5l$les.

A first clamp 24 includes a threaded shank 26 passing through the anchor plate 22 and provided with a tightening nut 27, a pair of jaws 28 pivotally connected to the shank at 29 and clamp tightening means 30. A cylinder 32 is secured to plate 23 and encloses a piston, not shown, to which is connected piston rod 33, carrying at its outer end a clamp 34 similar to clamp 24. Pressure may be applied to either side of the piston alternately through conduits 35 and 36 to pull the clamps apart for stretching purposes or to release them. As seen in Figure 3, the thin edge 14 of the lower sheet is disposed under the thick edge 15 of the top sheet at one edge of the billet and vice versa at the opposite edge of the billet. The mated articles thus define a billet in the form of a rectangular parallelopiped, that is, a solid having a rectangular cross-section at least in planes normal to the direction of the stretching tensions. In this manner, the original thin edges are temporarily eliminated and replaced by thick, resistant edges 17. The problem is hence changed from that of clamping and stretching a relatively easily deformable thin edge of a single sheet, which invariably results in damage to this edge, to that of operating only upon the thick edges of a built up body having no edge-portion that is thinner than the other portions of the body, all the edges being of equal thickness, and the cross-sectional area of the body being substantially uniform throughout in planes normal to the direction of stretch. 
 The edges being all of equal thickness, all are hence equally Well adapted to be clamped, and the sheets stretched, without damage thereto. The thin edge, and edge-portion of each of these sheets, by virtue of the foregoing arrangements and steps, remains in, or achieves, a rectilinear, or straight condition and is planeal, or smooth in the direction transverse of the sheet, in the direction extending longitudinally of the sheet, and in the direction extending thicknesswise of the sheet, that is, it is planeal or smooth in all three of the spatial-planes or space-directions and space-coordinate axes of solid geometry. These edges are, further, intact and unbroken and are therefore an integral, continuous or uninterrupted entity. Further this edge-portion has all its faces planeal and smooth and its edge is a right line, or, is rectilinear. Thus, if the sheets, in their pristine, original condition had a thin edge that was in this condition, it will remain in this pristine condition; if this edge was warped broken or wavy and irregular, when received for processing, it will be restored to the pristine, original condition it had when first formed and before it was damaged. 
 Accordingly, as shown in Figure 5, in the next step of the method, the machine is closed and tension is applied equally and oppositely to the equally thick opposite edges 17 For any strain not greatly exceeding the elastic limit, there is no possibility of the thin edge of any sheet being damaged by the metal working forces and small likelihood of its being damaged otherwise, as by clamping forces. 
 The adhesive by which the largest faces of the tapered sheets are temporarily united facewise as above can be either an age-weakening adhesive, that is, one having a time-disassociation period or one having a tendency to deteriorate with passage of time, such as one of the phenolic resorcinol glues, or a heat weakenable adhesive, such as one of the polyvinyl butyrals or solder. The equal and opposite tensions are applied with sufficient magnitude and for a sufficient time to establish the desired uniform crosssectional stress pattern and to eliminate the internal imbalance of stresses. 
 As shown in Figure 7, the edge-portions of the finished product may be elongated and thinned to be even thinner than originally without damage thereto. 7 
 After the completion of this step in this machine, the stretched billet is removed from the machine and either allowed to stand until the age-weakening adhesive disassociates sufficiently to be easily shearable, or the billet is heated to a temperature, short of the annealing point of the metal of the billet, adequate to liquefy the heat liquefiable adhesive. Usually, the latter temperature for the butyrals, is of the order of 250 F., insufficient to anneal the common metals and alloys. 
 Thereafter, the thus-treated billet is placed in a shear separating apparatus, such as the one representationally shown in Figure 6 and the components of the stretched billct are separated into individual sheets by shear-action along the plane of their union. 
 For concurrently or independently removing cobbles and other surface-rugosities from tapered sheets, the same procedure is followed, less force being required, of course, than when the aim is to establish a uniform balanced internal stress-field extending in all directions. In this case also, however, there exists no possibility of any thin edges being at all damaged tensilewise and small possibility of other damage occurring. In case compressive damage could occur, however, one of the aforesaid harder dummy sheets is employed and it will take these damagecausing forces off the other sheet. The dummy can again be used in the next cycle of operations. 
 In applying the invention to forming or contouring operations, it is obvious that it is only necessary to employ a stretch forming machine, preferably one with floating jaws such as one of the quite widely used and nationally advertised Hufford stretch presses, made and nationally distributed by the Hufford Machine Works, 1700 E. Grand Avenue, El Segundo, California; or a substantially similar such machine as made and nationally distributed by the T. W. and C. B. Sheridan Company, Lafayette Street, New York city. Since the constructional details and mechanism of such machine constitute as such no component of the present invention, which is a method in which such machine may or may not be employed (hand tools being usable), it needs no further mention herein. An operator may then assemble and mount the tapered sheets therein to lie in contact with a form block, generally proceeding thereafter in the manner aforedescribed. The method steps confer upon most of the sheets the desired single or double curved surface conformation or other desired contour, whereafter the sheets may be separated in a suitable shear separating machine and will then be ready for use. Those of the plurality of sheets which do not have the desired radii of curvature may be discarded or used later as the outer sheets. 
 The sheets may be temporarily united facewise to form the thick edged rectangular section billet by means other than adhesives if desired. For example, burrs r'ugosities or local protuberances, or the like 12 may be struck up from the largest faces of the sheets and these burrs on the respective faces will be interengaged sufficiently when pressure is applied perpendicularly to the faces to hold the sheets together against displacement in the stretch-levelling or other metal working operations but will permit the sheets to be easily shear separated, as in the aforementioned representational machine. 
 As shown in Figure 4, the billet may be formed of trapezoidal section tapered sheets, instead of the aforedescribed triangular section sheets. The method steps are the same in either case. 
 Although certain ones of the presently contemplated forms and physical expressions of the method and other inventive concepts have been described hereinabove by reference to specific parts and steps, it is to be understood that the invention is not thereby limited to such specific parts or particular steps, but is entitled to, and can, assume any specific form lying within the scope and ambit of the sub-joined claims.

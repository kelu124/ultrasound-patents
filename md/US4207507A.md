A signal generator for producing a control signal to control specific operations based upon the angular position of a rotating part in devices such as molding presses. An electrical signal related to the position of the rotating part is generated by using a potentiometer. The signal from the potentiometer is compared in a logic circuit to other adjustable electrical signals. Based upon the results of the comparison a control circuit provides the control signal. Furthermore, monitoring circuits are provided to detect any improper deviation in the electrical signals and upon detecting a deviation in an electrical signal the monitoring circuit provides an error output signal. An interrupter circuit is responsive to each monitoring device and disables the motion of the rotating part upon receipt of any error signal.

The invention relates to an electronic controller for generating electric control signals for specific angular positions of continuously rotating parts with a rotary potentiometer which is actuated by the rotating parts and delivers a measuring voltage which rises in proportion with the rotation of the potentiometer tapping and drops back to zero when a full rotation is reached and can be compared with adjustable make and break voltages to define the make and break point of the control signals.
Known controllers on devices with rotating parts, for example blanking or moulding presses, produce signals for the in-phase switching on and switching off of specific operations by mechanical means, using disc cams which are non-rotationally coupled to the rotating parts and adapted in the course of their rotation to actuate corresponding cam switches. In devices of this kind it is difficult to alter the make timing because to this end the disc cams would have to be rotated on the rotating parts or would have to be completely exchanged. Moreover, owing to the inertia of the mechanical parts delays occur in switching at high rotational speeds.
It would therefore be desirable for the control signals to be generated by electrical means. The measuring transducers, i.e. devices which deliver a voltage proportional to the angular position of the rotating part, used hitherto to this end are constructed, for example, as resolvers or as encoders; in each case these represent complex and expensive devices.
In this connection it would be substantially more convenient to use potentiometers which are rotated by the rotating parts; however, the use of such components was hitherto found to be impossible because of the poor definition in the transition region of the voltage tapped off between the beginning and end of the resistor track by the passage of the wiper arm thereover. Furthermore, difficulties occur if it is necessary to generate a control signal whose make point is situated at the end of the resistor track but whose break point is situated at the beginning of the resistor track. In this case it was hitherto necessary to generate two separate control signals, namely a first signal from the make time to the end of the resistor track and a second signal from the beginning of the resistor track to the break time.
As a result of these disadvantages inexpensive rotary potentiometers have not hitherto been used to generate control signals which are dependent on angular deflection.
It is the object of the invention to improve an electronic controller of the kind described hereinbefore so that precise generation of control signals is made possible even over the step response range of the rotary potentiometer despite the use of rotary potentiometers.
In apparatus of the kind described hereinbefore this problem is solved in accordance with the invention in that there is provided a first comparator for comparing the measuring voltage with the make voltage, by the provision of a third comparator for comparing the measuring voltage and the break voltage and by the provision of a second comparator for comparing the make voltage and the break voltage and that the outputs of the three comparators are connected to a logic circuit so that a control signal is switched on whenever the measuring voltage reaches the make voltage and is switched off whenever the measuring voltage reaches the break voltage.
The system can be arranged so that an EXCLUSIVE-OR-element, one of whose inputs in connected directly to the output of the first comparator and whose second input is connected to a logic switching unit which leaves the output signal of the third comparator unchanged if the make voltage is smaller than the break voltage but inverts the output signal of the third comparator if the make voltage is greater than the break voltage.
With a controller embodied in accordance with the invention it is possible to generate uninterrupted control signals from the selected make time to the selected break time even if the selected break voltage is less than the selected make voltage i.e. if the make time of the control signal extends from maximum to zero over the step in the measuring voltage which is tapped off from the rotary potentiometer.
Within the scope of this invention it is particularly advantageous that the rotary potentiometer is provided with two wiper arms set at a fixed angular spacing from each other, and changeover means which picks off an output voltage from the front wiper arm for as long as this is situated at a distance at 360째/0째 from the full angle of rotation of the potentiometer and forms an output voltage from the voltage of the rear wiper arm by adding thereto a supplementary voltage corresponding to the voltage between the two wiper arms as soon as the front wiper arm is situated in the region of the full angle of rotation and to produce the measuring voltage subtracts from the output voltage thus obtained a voltage which corresponds to the voltage on the front wiper arm in the position in which the switching means switch back from the rear to the front wiper arm.
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention it is possible to arrange that the rotary potentiometer has a first fixed voltage tapping for the supplementary voltage, a second fixed voltage tapping at an angle of rotation situated in front of the full angle of rotation of 360째 slightly more than corresponding to the angle between the two wiper arms and has a third fixed voltage tapping situated directly in front of the full angle of rotation of 360째 and that switching from the front to the rear wiper arm is performed for as long as the voltage on the rear wiper arm is between the voltages on the second and third voltage tapping.
Such rotary potentiometers have already been proposed and the present invention provides a particularly advantageous use of this type of rotary potentiometer.
To permit reliable operation of the electronic controller to be monitored the system can be arranged so that there is provided a monitoring circuit with a summing circuit for the voltage of the first fixed tapping, for the voltage between the front and rear wiper arm and for the voltage between the second and third fixed tapping as well as a window discriminator to detect any deviation of the sum of the said voltages from a fixed voltage value, the monitoring circuit generating an error signal in the event of a defined deviation of the summated voltage value from the fixed voltage value and a selector circuit is connected to the output of the window discriminator to suppress the error signal for as long as the switching means take off the output voltage from the rear wiper arm. This monitoring circuit monitors the operation of the rotary potentiometer only over the region in which the front wiper arm supplies the output voltage.
To monitor the operation of the rotary potentiometer over the remaining range it is possible to provide a comparator one input of which is supplied with the measuring voltage of the potentiometer and whose other input is supplied with the voltage of the second fixed tapping. This monitoring circuit can generate an error signal if the measured voltage of the potentiometer is below the voltage of the second fixed tapping. To ensure that such a monitoring circuit comes into operation only over the range which is not monitored by the above-described monitoring circuit the comparator can be followed by a selector circuit which suppresses the error signal for as long as the output voltage is picked off from the front wiper arm.
To improve reliability the monitoring circuit can be constructed in duplex form and generate an error signal in the event of any deviation of its error signal display.
To monitor the mechanical connection between the rotating part and the potentiometer it is possible to provide a comparator circuit which is supplied with at least one counting pulse by the potentiometer for each rotation thereof and is supplied by a pulse transmitter associated with the rotating part with an equal number of reset pulses for each rotation of said pulse transmitter. The comparator circuit generates an error signal in the event of any deviation between the number of counting and reset pulses during one rotation.
Finally, to monitor the connections which transmit the potentiometer measuring voltages to the control circuits, a fixed voltage can be superimposed on the measured potentiometer voltage. The control circuit is then associated with a detector circuit which generates an error signal if the fixed voltage is absent.
All error signals are supplied to an interrupter circuit which stops the motion of the rotating part.
Further advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims and are disclosed therein.

The construction and operation of rotary potentiometer with two wiper arms which is particularly suited as angle function generator within the scope of the electronic controller according to the invention will first be explained by reference to FIGS. 1 to 3.
FIG. 1 shows the track 1 of the rotary potentiometer in developed form. Normally such a track is re-entrant. An operating voltage U1, which remains constant during the entire operation, is connected via terminals 2 and 3 to the resistor track 1 which consists of electrically conductive material with a very high mechanical resistance. A voltage U2 is appled between the terminal 2 and a first fixed voltage tapping 4, a voltage U3 supplied between the terminal 2 and a second fixed voltage tapping 5 and a voltage U4 is applied between the terminal 2 and a third fixed voltage tapping 6.
A front wiper arm 7 and a rear wiper arm 8 are angularly offset from each other so that a voltage, precisely equal to the voltage U2 between the terminal 2 and the first tapping 4, is established between said wiper arms. The angular distance between the two wiper arms remains constant.
A switching unit 9, illustrated in FIG. 2 and generating a switch control signal for alternately picking off, in a manner to be described subsequently, the voltage applied to the front wiper arm 7 and the voltage applied to the rear wiper arm 8, is provided to generate a potentiometer measuring voltage which rises continuously from zero to a maximum value during a full rotation of the rotary potentiometer and on reach such maximum value drops back in defined manner to the zero value.
The switching unit 9 comprises two comparators 10,11 whose outputs 12 and 13 are connected to the inputs 14,15 of a summing amplifier 16. The voltage between the terminal 2 and the rear wiper arm 8 (US) is applied to both positive inputs 17 or 18 of the comparators 10 and 11, the voltage U4 is applied to the negative input 19 of the comparator 10 and the voltage U3 is applied to the negative input 20 of the comparator 11.
The voltage characteristic shown under A in FIG. 3 will be obtained from the output 13 of the comparator 11 as the result of sliding of the two wiper arms 7,8 if the angular position between the two wiper arms is 40째 and if the second fixed tapping 5 is situated at an angular position of 300째 and the third fixed tapping is situated at an angular position 330째. The voltage between the rear wiper arm 8 and the terminal 2 exceeds the voltage U3 if the angular position of the front wiper arm 7 exceeds 340째 so that the output signal of the comparator 11 is triggered. This output signal is swept back into the starting position as soon as the rear wiper arm reaches the 360째-0째 transition, i.e. when the front wiper arm 7 is set at an angle of 40째.
In like manner the output signal of the comparator 10 is triggered in the manner illustrated under B in FIG. 3 as soon as the voltage US exceeds the voltage U4, i.e. when the front wiper arm 7 is set at an angle of 10째. This comparator is also swept back into the starting position as soon as the rear wiper 8 passes by the 360째-0째 transition.
A signal characteristic as illustrated under C in FIG. 3 is obtained at the output 21 of the summing amplifier 16 by virtue of the latter forming a difference between the output signals obtained from the comparators 10 and 11. A signal voltage occurs on the output 21 if the front wiper arm is set at an angle between 340째 and 10째.
This signal voltage is used in a manner not shown for alternately picking off the output voltage of the potentiometer from the front wiper arm 7 and from the rear wiper arm 8.
In the explanations which follow references to angles always refer to the position of the front wiper arm 7.
In the absence of an output signal at the output 21 (angular range between 10째 and 340째) the output voltage will correspond to the voltage on the front wiper arm 7 (solid line in FIG. 3). When an output signal appears at the output 21 (angular range 340째 to 10째) the output voltage will correspond to the voltage US on the rear wiper arm 8 to which the constant voltage U2 is added (dotted voltage characteristic). The output voltage of the potentiometer is therefore illustrated by the solid line for the region between 10째 and 340째 and by the dotted line between 340째 and 10째. It will be seen that this voltage does not drop to zero for any angular position. To achieve this effect a constant voltage is subtracted from the output voltage to provide the voltage which will be referred to hereinafter as measuring voltage. The constant voltage which is to be subtracted from the output voltage is selected so that the measuring voltage drops to zero immediately after changeover, i.e. for an angular position of 10째. Rotation of the potentiometer therefore results in a measuring voltage which rises linearly from zero to the maximum value. The essential feature is that the step response from maximum value to minimum value is sharply defined because such step response is triggered by operation of the comparator 10. This is achieved by the rear wiper 8 which will then still be situated at a safe distance from the undefined end region of the resistor track. FIG. 3 shows the voltage on the rear wiper arm 8 in broken lines and the measuring voltage in dotted lines. The use of the rotary potentiometer described above therefore enables an analogous measuring voltage to be generated which is precisely proportional to the angular position of the rotating part over the entire range thereof. This measuring voltage is utilized within the scope of the present invention to generate control signals at specific angular positions in order to trigger specific operations etc.
FIG. 4 shows a circuit by means of which such a control signal can be generated. The circuit has two variable potentiometers 22 and 23 for generating an adjustable make voltage UE and for generating an adjustable break voltage UA. The tapping 24 of the potentiometer 22 is connected to one input 25 of a first comparator 26 and to one input 27 of a second comparator 28. The tapping 29 of the potentiometer 23 is connected to one input 30 of a third comparator 31 as well as to the second input 32 of the second comparator 28. The other inputs 33 and 34 of the first comparator 26 and of the third comparator 31 are together connected to the output 35 of a decoupling network 36 through which the inputs 33 and 34 are supplied with the measuring voltage generated by the rotary potentiometer 37 which is connected to the rotating part but shown only diagrammatically in the drawing.
The output 38 of the first comparator is connected to the input 39 of an exclusive OR-network 40. The output of the second comparator 28 is connected via an inverter 42 to one input 43 of a first AND-network 44 and is connected directly to one input 45 of a second AND-network 46. The output 47 of the third comparator 31 is also connected via an inverter 48 to the second input 49 of the second AND-network 46 and is connected directly to the second input 50 of the first AND-network 44. The outputs 51 and 52 of the AND-networks 44 or 46 are connected to the inputs 53 or 54 of a second exclusive OR-network 55 whose output 56 is connected to the second input 57 of the exclusive OR-network 40.
The control circuit described herein produces the desired control signal at the output 58 of the exclusive OR-network 40.
The method of operation of the control circuit will be explained hereinbelow. A positive signal at the output of one of the logic circuit elements contained in the circuit will hereinafter be designated 1 and a negative signal will be designated 0.
A 1 appears at the output of the comparator 26 if the measuring voltage is greater than the make voltage UE which is connected to the potentiometer 22 and a 0 will appear at the output 38 if the measuring voltage is below UE. The same applies to the output 47 of the comparator 31 as regards the break voltage UA which is connected to the potentiometer 23.
A 0 will appear at the output 41 of the comparator 28 if the break voltage UA is greater than the make voltage UE. This is always the case if the make and break times occur between 0째 and 360째. If the make time occurs before 360째 is reached but the break time occurs thereafter the make voltage UE will be greater than the break voltage UA ; a 1 will then appear at the output 41 of the comparator 28.
The same signal that appears at the output 47 of the comparator appears at the output 56 of the exclusive OR-network 55 if the output signal of the comparator 28 is 0, as is readily evident by the logic functions of the inverters 42 and 48 of the AND-networks 44 and 46 and of the exclusive OR-network 55. If this output signal is 1 the signal appearing at the output 56 of the exclusive OR-network 55 will be inverted with respect to the signal appearing at the output 47 of the comparator 31.
In the event that the break voltage is greater than the make voltage (comparator 28 supplies 0) a control signal will always appear at the output 58 of the exclusive OR-network 40 if the measuring voltage is between the make voltage UE and the break voltage UA.
If the break voltage UA is smaller than the make voltage UD the output 58 will provide a control signal whenever the measuring voltage is not between the make voltage and the break voltage but only if the measuring voltage is either above the make voltage or below the break voltage.
This control circuit therefore achieves the continuous generation of a control signal which commences when the measuring voltages reaches the make voltage and terminates when the measuring voltage reaches the break voltage irrespective of whether a step response of the measuring voltage occurs for the duration of the control signal. It is therefore possible to generate a control pulse of any desired length and phase by means of one and the same control circuit.
Different monitoring circuits are provided for the individual components of the control to ensure reliable operation of the electronic controller described herein.
The simple construction of the switching device associated with the rotary potentiometer for alternately picking off the potentiometer output voltages from both wiper arms thereof and the likewise simple construction of the control circuit illustrated in FIG. 4 enables these circuits to be provided in duplex configuration for checking purposes. The output signals thus generated, namely the control signal which occurs on switchover and is shown under C in FIG. 3 and the control signal which appears at the output 58 of the control circuit, are always compared with the same signal of the parallel circuit. An error signal is generated in a manner not shown if deviations occur.
The circuits illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 are suitable for monitoring the operation of the two-armed rotary potentiometer itself.
The circuit of FIG. 5 incorporates a summing amplifier 59 whose positive input 60 carries a summated voltage comprising the voltage U4, U2 and the voltage UT between the terminal 2 and the front wiper arm 7 and whose negative input 61 carries a second summated voltage comprising the voltages U3 and US. The summated voltage UE at the output 62 of the summing amplifier 59 comprises the sum of the voltages between the terminal 2 and the first fixed tapping 4, the rear wiper arm 8 and the front wiper arm 7 and the second tapping 5 and the third tapping 6. This summated voltage UD is applied to the input 63 of a window discriminator 64 of known construction whose output 65 carries a signal only if the summated voltage UD deviates from a fixed voltage in the positive or negative direction by a specific amount. The output 65 is connected to the input 66 of an AND-network 67 whose second input 68 is connected via an inverter 69 in a manner not shown to the output 21 of the switching means illustrated in FIG. 2.
The summated voltage UD monitors the operation of the rotary potentiometer. In the event of failure of any operation of the said potentiometer the voltage UD will change so that a signal appears at the output 65 of the window discriminator 64. If no signal is generated at the output 21 of the switching means a 1 will be applied to the input 68 of the AND-network 67 so that an error signal is generated at the output 70 of the AND-network if the output 65 of the window discriminator 64 also carries a 1. However, the AND-network 67 does not allow an error signal to pass if a control signal is supplied to the output 21 of the switching means. The monitoring circuit of FIG. 5 is therefore effective only in the range in which the output voltage is picked off from the front wiper 7, i.e. in an angular position between 10째 and 340째 in the illustrated example.
The remainder of the range can be monitored by means of the monitoring circuit illustrated in FIG. 6. This comprises a comparator 71 whose first input 72 carries the voltage U3 and whose second input 73 carries the measuring voltage UMeB. The output 74 of the comparator 71 is connected via an inverter 75 to the input 76 of an AND-network 77 whose second input 78 is connected in like manner to the output 21 as in the case of the AND-network 67 of FIG. 5.
If the measuring voltage is greater than the voltage U3 the output 74 will carry a 1 and a 0 will appear at the input 76 of the AND-network 77 owing to the presence of the inverter 75. Accordingly, no error signal appears at the output 79 of the AND-network 77. However, if the measuring voltage is below the voltage U3 a 1 will appear at the input 76 of the AND-network 77. If a 1 is also applied to the input 78 an error signal will appear at the output 79. This is the case if the switching means of FIG. 2 generate an output signal, i.e. if the output voltage is picked off from the rear wiper 8 (between 340째 and 10째). The monitoring circuit of FIG. 6 therefore checks whether the measuring voltage over the entire switching range is above the voltage U3. It therefore also checks whether changeover switching from the front wiper 7 to the rear wiper 8 has taken place because after the transition the front wiper 7 will have only a very low voltage so that the measuring voltage derived therefrom would be below U3.
In their entirety the monitoring circuits illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 therefore monitor the operation of the rotary potentiometer described herein over its entire range of rotation.
A further check is necessary to ensure reliable rotary connection between the rotating part and the rotary potentiometer. This can be achieved in a simple manner if at least one counting pulse is supplied by the rotary potentiometer for each rotation to a counter and an identical number of reset pulses is supplied for each rotation of the part by a pulse transmitter which is associated with said rotating part. If the rotary connection is in order the counter will receive the same number of counting and reset pulses for each rotation. However, if the rotary connection is faulty the number of counting pulses and rotation pulses will deviate from each other. In such a case the counter will generate an error signal.
To check correct operation of the device which generates the reset pulses it is possible to provide an additional counter to which the reset pulses are supplied in the form of counting pulses and the counting pulses of the rotary potentiometer are supplied as reset pulses. If the pulse transmitter associated with the rotating part operates incorrectly the above-mentioned counter will deliver an error signal.
To ensure that the monitoring circuits illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 function reliably they can be embodied in duplex configuration and can be compared with each other. An error signal will be generated in the event of a deviation occurring.
Finally, to monitor the line which transmits the measured signal to the control circuit it is possible to apply to such a line a specific base voltage, for example of 1 V, which is tested by a detector circuit associated with the corresponding control circuit. This voltage is superimposed on the measuring voltage and is subtracted therefrom in the control circuit. The detector voltage will deliver an error signal if it detects failure of the superimposed voltage when the measuring voltage drops to 0.
The error signals generated in the circuits described herein are supplied to an interrupter circuit which immediately interrupts the drive for the rotating part if a single error signal occurs. Such interrupter circuits are known and are therefore not described in detail.
By virtue of its embodiment as illustrated the electronic controller described hereinabove is suitable not only for generating control pulses of any desired duratior and phase but it is self-testing for all its functions so as to ensure completely reliable operation.
FIG. 7 shows a practical embodiment of such as electronic controller.
A first chassis 80 with an ON-OFF switch 81, a signal lamp 82 and a fuse casing 83 also houses the switching means for the rotary potentiometer, i.e. the circuit which controls voltage pick-off from the rotary potentiometer and generates the measuring voltage. In the second chassis are disposed the error circuit illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, which said circuit is duplicated in the manner described where appropriate. Signal lamps 86 and 85 indicate reliable operation or a fault.
A third chassis 87 accommodates a control circuit for generating a control pulse. The make potentiometer 22 of the control circuit illustrated in FIG. 4 can be set by means of a first actuating knob 88 and the break potentiometer 23 can be set by means of a second actuating knob 89. A signal lamp 90 indicates the presence of a control signal. The chassis 91 is of substantially identical construction as that of the chassis 87 but the control circuit is duplicated in the manner already described. An error circuit which compares the output signals of the control circuits indicates by means of two signal lamps 92,93 whether the control circuit operates reliably. Furthermore, where appropriate it also transmits an error signal to the interrupter circuit.
The chassis 80 and 94 can be followed by any desired number of separate control circuits which are either of single-channel configuration as in the chassis 87 or double-channel configuration as in the chassis 91. FIG. 7 shows that a two-channel chassis 91 is followed by a further single-channel chassis 94 whose construction is identical to that of the chassis 87.
To monitor the angular position of the rotating part the chassis 80 also contains an indicating device 95 which is directly driven by the measuring voltage. The illustrated indicating instrument is a digital display instrument calibrated to an angular range of 360째 but analog display instruments can also be employed.
To ensure reliably that the error circuits interrupt the motion of the rotating part even if the rotary potentiometer is rotated very rapidly and the error signals are therefore very brief, it is possible for the interrupter circuit to be preceded by a memory element which converts even the briefest error pulses into signals to which the interrupter circuit can respond.

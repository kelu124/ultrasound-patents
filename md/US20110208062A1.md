BACKGROUND
 [0002]  1. Technical Field
  [0003]  The present disclosure relates generally to equipment and procedures in the field of spinal surgery and, in exemplary implementations, to instruments, systems and methods for positioning and/or evaluating the positioning of pedicle screws in connection with orthopedic applications.
  [0004]  2. Background Art
  [0005]  Surgical techniques for spinal fixation vary widely in terms of the types of surgical equipment used, but modern surgical practice continues to rely quite heavily on the strength and stability afforded by the common pedicle screw. However, care must be taken during pedicle screw placement to protect against nerve damage. For example, after forming a pilot hole in the bone tissue of a pedicle but before moving forward with pedicle screw implantation, surgeons will typically take the opportunity to inspect the axially-extending side walls of the pilot hole to locate defects. With the advent and increasing use of minimally invasive surgical procedures that afford only a limited view with respect to anatomical structure, the risk of misplaced pedicle screws has increased. In the event a surgeon locates a breach of any significant size of the cortical bone adjacent the spinal column, he or she will mostly likely elect to redirect the screw to avoid the risk of complications such as pain, paralysis and hemorrhaging.
  [0006]  One method for locating such cortical breaches in regular use by surgeons is tissue palpation by means of the common tactile feeler probe. While surgeons are aware that this method has its limitations, including with regard to sensitivity in the case of relatively small breaches, as well as with regard to false positives, many if not most have become comfortable with the use of the tactile feeler probe. To the extent techniques and tools can be developed to facilitate continued effective use of tactile diagnostic techniques in the context of minimally invasive spinal surgical procedures, there is likely to be a strong market for same among current practitioners.
  [0007]  Recent developments in the use of ultrasound technology in surgical applications have shown promise. With the increasing miniaturization of electronics generally has come the ability to position ultrasound transducers to beneficial effect in increasingly smaller and, at least up until recently, harder to reach anatomical locations. Nevertheless, and despite efforts to date, a need remains for convenient, sanitary, low-cost, and effective equipment and related techniques for locating pilot hole bone tissue defects prior to pedicle screw implantation.
  [0008]  These and other needs are satisfied by the instruments, systems and methods disclosed herein, as will be apparent from the detailed description which follows, particularly when read in conjunction with the figures appended hereto.
 SUMMARY
 [0009]  The present disclosure provides advantageous instruments, systems and methods for obtaining and/or determining anatomical information, e.g., locating pilot hole bone tissue defects prior to pedicle screw implantation.
  [0010]  In exemplary embodiments, a medical diagnostic instrument is provided that includes: (i) a proximal handle configured and dimensioned to permit an operator to manually grasp the instrument; (ii) an ultrasound probe including a longitudinal shaft extending distally from the handle and terminating in a distal end, and an ultrasound transducer mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft, the ultrasound transducer including an array of ultrasonic energy generation elements (iii) a tactile feeler probe mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe; and (iv) at least one hollow receiver member mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe, wherein the at least one hollow receiver member is configured and dimensioned to receive a K-wire to permit the instrument to be slidably mounted thereto for purposes of guiding the ultrasound and tactile feeler probes axially relative to a desired anatomical location.
  [0011]  The ultrasound transducer and the distal end are generally cooperatively configured, oriented, and dimensioned to permit the operator to insert the ultrasound transducer and the distal end into a desired anatomical location to permit the operator to obtain thereat a corresponding two-dimensional image of the anatomical location for visual inspection by the operator for purposes of detecting ultrasonically-detectable anatomical properties. The array of ultrasonic energy generation elements may be side-firing and may be oriented in a linear array or a phased array. In addition, a feeler probe tip and a longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe are generally cooperatively configured and dimensioned to permit the operator to insert the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe into the desired anatomical location to permit the operator to perform thereat a tactile inspection of the selected anatomical location.
  [0012]  The disclosed medical diagnostic instrument may be advantageously employed in connection with a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of the human patient. In addition, the array of ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer may extend axially along, and be positioned against, a selected portion of a side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole. The feeler probe tip may be positioned against the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole. The medical diagnostic instrument may also include at least one channel in or adjacent to the handle of the instrument, the channel configured and dimensioned to receive the K-wire to permit the instrument to be slidably mounted thereto for purposes of guiding the ultrasound and tactile feeler probes axially relative to the desired anatomical location. Thus, the channel may be in the handle and extend therethrough, and/or be formed in an extension of the handle and extend therepast. The handle and the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe may be of unitary construction or the ultrasound probe may be mounted with respect to the handle such that the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe is supported, cantilever-style, by the handle housing. In addition, the tactile feeler probe may be mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe such that the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe is supported, cantilever-style, by the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe.

  [0014]  The array of ultrasonic energy generation elements generally defines an axial length along the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe of between about 8 millimeters and about 12 millimeters. In addition, the tactile feeler probe typically extends distally beyond the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe such that the longitudinal shaft and the feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe collectively define an axial length of the tactile feeler probe beyond the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of between about 8 millimeters and about 12 millimeters.

The present disclosure also provides for a medical diagnostic instrument wherein at least a portion of the second hollow receiver member is mounted with respect to the handle.
  [0016]  The present disclosure also provides for a medical diagnostic instrument wherein the at least one hollow receiver member extends from a distal portion of the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe to a proximal end of the ultrasound probe.

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT(S)
 [0049]  In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, advantageous medical diagnostic instruments, systems and methods are provided for use during a broad variety of spinal surgical applications. The present disclosure provides improved equipment and advantageous methods for combining the comfort and familiarity of tactile inspection techniques with increasingly effective ultrasound imaging techniques to assist surgeons, for example, in quickly and conveniently inspecting pilot holes for bone tissue defects prior to pedicle screw implantation.
  [0050]  Referring now to FIG. 1, a medical diagnostic system 101 in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. The system 101 includes a medical diagnostic instrument 103 which may include a first cable assembly 105. The system 103 also includes an ultrasound console 107 and a second cable assembly 109.
  [0051]  The instrument 103 includes a handle 111. The handle 111 is disposable proximate an operator (not shown) of the instrument 103 and is configured and dimensioned to permit the operator (not shown) to manually grasp the instrument 103, and to manipulate the instrument 103 relative to the spine of a human patient (not shown).
  [0052]  The instrument 103 further includes an ultrasound probe 113. The ultrasound probe 113 includes a longitudinal shaft 115 extending distally from the handle 111 and terminating in a distal end 117. The ultrasound probe 113 further includes an ultrasound transducer 119 mounted to the longitudinal shaft 115 proximate the distal end 117 thereof. The ultrasound transducer 119 includes an array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements (not separately shown) extending along the longitudinal shaft 115.
  [0053]  The ultrasound transducer 119 and the distal end 117 are cooperatively configured, oriented, and dimensioned to permit the operator (not shown) to insert the ultrasound transducer 119 and the distal end 117 into a pedicle screw pilot hole (not shown) formed in the spine of the human patient (not shown) such that the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer 119 extends axially along, and is positioned against, a selected portion of a side wall (not shown) of the pedicle screw pilot hole, and to permit the operator to obtain thereat a corresponding two-dimensional image (not shown) of the selected portion of the side wall for visual inspection by the operator for purposes of detecting ultrasonically-detectable cortical breaches located therein (not shown).
  [0054]  The instrument 103 further includes a tactile feeler probe 121 mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe 113, the tactile feeler probe 121 including a longitudinal shaft 123 mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 and extending distally therefrom beyond the distal end 117 thereof, and a feeler probe tip 125 defined at a distal end 127 of the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121, the feeler probe tip 125 and the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 being cooperatively configured and dimensioned to permit the operator (not shown) to insert the feeler probe tip 125 and the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 into the pedicle screw pilot hole (not shown) such that the feeler probe tip 125 is positioned against the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole (not shown), and to permit the operator to perform thereat a tactile inspection of the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole for purposes of detecting manually detectable cortical breaches located therein (not shown).
  [0055]  As indicated above, the instrument 103 may further include a first cable assembly 105. The first cable assembly 105 may be configured and arranged to carry electrical signals to and from the ultrasound transducer 119 in accordance with an ultrasonic imaging mode of use of the instrument 103. The first cable assembly 105 may include a proximal end 129 including a first electrical connector 131 for connecting the instrument 103 to a corresponding ultrasound console 107 and current carrying wires (not separately shown) extending distally from the electrical connector 131, through the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 and to the ultrasound transducer 119.
  [0056]  The ultrasound console 107 includes a processor 133 for controlling the instrument 103, a display 135 for displaying two-dimensional ultrasonic images obtained from the instrument 103 by an operator thereof, and a port 137 for receiving a corresponding cable connector.
  [0057]  As indicated above, the system 101 includes a second cable assembly 109 for carrying electrical signals to and from the ultrasound console 107.

  [0059]  Turning now to FIGS. 1 and 2, the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 may define a longitudinal axis 201 along which the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 extends distally from the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113, and a longitudinal axis 203 along which the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 extends distally to the feeler probe tip 125, and a bend 205 formed therebetween such that the longitudinal axis 201 and the longitudinal axis 203 collectively define a first plane (represented in FIG. 2 by the plane in which FIG. 2 appears). The longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 may define a longitudinal axis 207 along which the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 extends distally from the handle 111. The side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the array thereof (not separately shown) may define a longitudinal axis 209 along which the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extends.

  [0085]  In one embodiment, first hollow receiver member 8017B is positioned or mounted with respect to a proximal end of probe 8011B, and second hollow receiver member 8017B′ is positioned or mounted with respect to a distal portion of probe 8011B, although the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The housing of the handle of the medical diagnostic instrument for use with probe 8011B may be configured and dimensioned to house and/or mount with respect to at least a portion of first hollow receiver member 8017B. For example, at least a portion of first hollow receiver member 8017B defines at least a portion of a channel through the housing of the handle of the medical diagnostic instrument for use with probe 8011B. The housing of the handle of the medical diagnostic instrument for use with probe 8011B may or may not include a separate channel through the handle for use with the K-wire (i.e., separate from first hollow receiver member 8017B housed in the housing). In exemplary embodiments, the longitudinal axis defined by the first hollow receiver member 8017B is substantially the same as and/or is substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis defined by the second hollow receiver member 8017B′ (i.e., the same K-wire 1509 would extend through first hollow receiver member 8017B and second hollow receiver member 8017B′).
  [0086]  Variations and modifications of the above-described medical diagnostic instruments are possible in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. In accordance with some such variations and modifications (not shown), the handle and the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe (and/or the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and the hollow receiver members) are of unitary construction with respect to each other. Each of the above-described diagnostic instruments may be equipped with a cable assembly for carrying electrical signals to and from the ultrasound transducer in accordance with an ultrasonic imaging mode of use of the instrument, the cable assembly including a proximal end including an electrical connector for connecting the instrument to a corresponding ultrasound console and current carrying wires extending distally from the electrical connector to the ultrasound transducer at least partially via a corresponding interior conduit formed in and extending longitudinally along the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe.

  [0091]  Various case examples of instrumented spine surgery to which the presently disclosed technology may be applied for the benefit of spinal patients suffering from a variety of spinal diseases, degenerative conditions and diseases, are shown in FIGS. 26-39. A spinal implant 2601 is shown via FIGS. 26, 27 and 28, such implant having been implanted for the benefit of a patient afflicted with an L2/3 listhesis. A spinal implant 2901 is shown via FIGS. 29, 30 and 31, such implant having been implanted for the benefit of a patient that suffered an L2 burst fracture. A patient suffering from an L1 burst, including progressive Kyphosis, pain and paraparesis, may benefit from implantation of a spinal implant 3201, as shown in FIGS. 32, 33 and 34. A patient diagnosed with metastatic bone disease may be treated with spinal surgical apparatus 3501, as shown in FIGS. 35, 36 and 37. Images of spinal surgical apparatus 3801, 3803 and 3805, and an associated spinal implant 3901, are shown in FIGS. 38 and 39 (in which an example of minimally invasive surgery is illustrated). As discussed, the presently disclosed technology may be employed in conjunction with such spinal implant applications, as well as spinal implant applications similar thereto.
  [0092]  Referring now to FIGS. 40 and 41, existing technology for locating breaches in the cortical bone tissue of spinal pedicles is depicted. More particularly, diagnostic apparatus such as the apparatus 4001 may be used with integrated display technology (such as a screen display 4101) to implement a scheme for intraoperative monitoring of electrical current with respect to a predetermined threshold, wherein observed current in excess of the predetermined threshold is taken as a strong indication of the presence of an inappropriate cortical breach. However, the systems, apparatus and methods of the present disclosure offer superior results and clinical benefits as compared to such prior art technology.
  [0093]  Referring now to information shown and described in FIGS. 42-50, tests have been performed with respect to animal vertebral bodies using a 2.7 mm diameter ultrasound probe in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Associated test materials are shown in FIG. 42, relevant anatomy is shown in FIG. 43, and associated testing methods are illustrated in FIG. 44. Large and small pedicle breaches are exemplified in images encompassed by FIG. 45. Examples of test materials presenting an intact pedicle (i.e., a pedicle having no breach in the side walls of the pedicle entry hole such as would result in the pedicle entry hole communicating with the spinal canal) are shown in images encompassed by FIG. 46. Examples of experimental controls, including with respect to the response of the probe in air and water, are shown in FIG. 47. The images of FIG. 48 show that no applicable signal was detected with the test probe in the example of an intact pedicle with no breach. As shown in FIG. 49, employment of the test probe in conjunction with test materials in which a large pedicle breach was present resulted in the test probe detecting such large breach. As shown in FIG. 50, employment of the test probe in conjunction with test materials in which a small pedicle breach was present resulted in the test probe detecting such small breach.
  [0094]  Referring now to information shown and described in FIGS. 51-55, further tests have been conducted with respect to human cadaveric subjects. FIG. 51 illustrates a related test setup. As shown in images encompassed by FIG. 52, the tests included the use of a 3.18 mm side-firing ultrasound probe fitted with a detachable pedicle feeler/sounder in accordance with the present disclosure. Various methods and techniques associated with the human cadaveric tests are shown in the images encompassed by FIG. 53. Some results corresponding to data collected and compared for a metal pedicle feeler (top) versus the use of pedicle ultrasound in accordance with the techniques and apparatus of the present disclosure are shown in the images encompassed by FIG. 54. Further results exemplifying the diagnostic power of the techniques and apparatus of the present disclosure, are shown in the images encompassed by FIG. 55 and corresponding respectively to: 1) a normal pedicle with no breach, 2) a 2.5 mm pedicle breach, and 3) a 4.0 mm pedicle breach.
  [0095]  Test results with respect to 2.5 mm and 4.0 mm pedicle breaches and related explanatory information are set forth in the following tables. For purposes of the tables, the following terms are defined:
   Sensitivity=(# true pos.)/[(# true pos.)+(# false neg.)] Specificity=(# true neg.)/[(# true neg.)+(# false pos.)] Positive Predictive Value (PPV)=(# true pos.)/[(# true pos.)+(# false pos.)] Negative Predictive Value (NPV)=(# true neg.)/[(# true neg.)+(# false neg.)]

  [0100]  Based on the foregoing test results, including specifically the noted human cadaveric tests, the following conclusions have been reached:
   The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods (pedicle ultrasound) has a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value as compared to the “classic” pedicle feeler. The noted difference is greater with extremely small breaches (2.5 mm vs. 4.0 mm) With larger breaches (4.0 mm), the detection of breaches approaches a sensitivity and specificity of 100% using the pedicle ultrasound system. The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods facilitate screening tests and/or related diagnostics to determine/detect whether a breach in cortical bone has occurred when placing pedicle screws into the spine. The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods allow surgeons and other health care personnel to reduce the likelihood that pedicle screws will be misplaced in spinal surgery, thereby translating to more effective health care.   

  [0106]  In operation, and as illustrated in FIGS. 56 and 57, the above described diagnostic instruments may be used to explore a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of a human patient for cortical breaches located in the axially-extending side-walls thereof. As shown in FIGS. 56 and 57, a medical diagnostic instrument 6001 in accordance with the present disclosure is presented. The instrument includes a handle, an ultrasound probe, and a tactile feeler probe. The ultrasound probe includes a longitudinal shaft extending distally from the handle and terminating in a distal end, and an ultrasound transducer mounted to the longitudinal shaft proximate the distal end thereof. The ultrasound transducer includes an array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extending along the longitudinal shaft.
  [0107]  The tactile feeler probe is mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe and includes a longitudinal shaft mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and extending distally therefrom beyond the distal end thereof. The tactile feeler probe includes a feeler probe tip defined at a distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe.
  [0108]  The handle is employed to manually grasp and manipulate the medical diagnostic instrument relative to the spine of a human patient, including inserting the ultrasound transducer and the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe, and the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe into a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of the human patient.
  [0109]  The feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe is positioned relative to a selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole such that the feeler probe tip is positioned against the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole.
  [0110]  The feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe is employed to perform a tactile inspection of the selected portion of the side wall for purposes of detecting manually-detectable cortical breaches located therein.
  [0111]  The array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer are positioned relative to selected portion of a side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole such that the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extends axially along, and is positioned against, the selected portion of a side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole.
  [0112]  The array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer is employed to obtain a two-dimensional image of the selected portion of the side wall for visual inspection for purposes of detecting ultrasonically-detectable cortical breaches located therein.
  [0113]  The two positioning and the two array employment steps are performed without removing any of the ultrasound transducer or the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe or the feeler probe tip of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe from the pedicle screw pilot hole.
  [0114]  The instrument may be mounted and slid along a K-wire (not specifically shown) to guide the ultrasound and tactile feeler probes axially relative to the pedicle screw pilot hole during a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Alternatively, and/or in addition, the instrument may be mounted with respect to one or more guide wires other than a K-wire.
  [0115]  With reference to FIGS. 58-59, a further implementation according to the present disclosure is shown. Thus, a modified Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 may be employed with an ultrasound probe assembly in clinical applications, e.g., to detect/determine a breach in the cortical bone associated with pedicle screw placement. The Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 generally takes the form of a long hollow needle 7006 with a tapered cutting edge at a distal end thereof. A handle 7004 is mounted with respect to the needle 7006 and defines an aperture for receipt of an inner needle (not pictured) and ancillary element(s). In conventional use of a Jamshidi-style needle, the inner needle may be removed once a desired anatomical location is reached and a syringe may be introduced through the aperture formed in the handle for use in sampling tissue, e.g., bone marrow. However, in the exemplary implementation disclosed herein, after removal of the inner needle (not pictured), the aperture formed in handle 7004 of Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 is configured and dimensioned to receive an elongated ultrasound probe 7010 associated with ultrasound assembly 7002. In exemplary implementations, the ultrasound assembly 7002 includes a handle member 7008 that defines a fitting for connection to conventional cabling.
  [0116]  In use, the Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 is introduced to a desired clinical location, e.g., within cortical bone that has been pre-drilled for receipt of a pedicle screw, and the inner needle (not pictured) is removed. Ultrasound probe 7010 is then introduced through the aperture formed in the handle 7004 of the Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 for advantageous ultrasound detection of relevant information, e.g., a breach of the cortical bone. In exemplary implementations, needle 7006 is approximately 7.5 cm in length and the inner diameter of needle 7006 is approximately 3 mm. Alternative dimensions may be employed without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.
  [0117]  Although the systems, apparatus and methods have been described with respect to exemplary embodiments herein, it is apparent that modifications, variations, changes and/or enhancements may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, as an alternative to the use of a side-firing ultrasound transducer as described hereinabove, and/or in addition thereto, one or more end-firing ultrasound transducers, and/or 360 degree ultrasound transducers may be employed, whether mounted with respect to the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the associated ultrasound probe, adjacent thereto, or otherwise, for use as desired by the surgical practitioner. Ultrasound probes and systems in accordance with the present disclosure may employ or embody one or more of a variety of modes of ultrasound, including but not necessarily limited to Ultrasound Mode A, Ultrasound Mode B, Ultrasound Mode M, Ultrasound DM Mode, as well as color and three-dimensional modes. Other instruments may be modularly attached in addition to, and/or in place of a tactile feeler probe, including but not limited to curettes, nerve hooks, Woodsons, and/or Murphey Balls. Accordingly, the present disclosure expressly encompasses all such modifications, variations, changes and/or enhancements.

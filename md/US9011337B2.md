In some embodiments, the ultrasound energy can be transmitted to depths below a skin surface in a range from about 10 mm to about 150 mm, or from about 10 mm to about 100 mm, or from about 10 mm to about 50 mm, or from about 10 mm about 30 mm, or from about 10 mm to about 20 mm, or from about 0 mm to about 10 mm.
In some embodiments, the ultrasound energy can be transmitted to depths at or below a skin surface in the range from about 20 mm to about 150 mm, or from about 20 mm to about 100 mm, or from about 20 mm to about 50 mm, or from about 20 mm to about 30 mm. In some embodiments, the ultrasound energy can be transmitted to depths at below a skin surface in a range from about 30 mm to about 150 mm, or from about 30 mm to about 100 mm, or from about 30 mm to about 50 mm.

Moving to FIG. 2, a graph illustrates efficiency of an ultrasound transducer at specific frequency fc, in accordance with various embodiments. Efficiency of a transducer is defined as the ratio of the power output in the desired form to the total power input. Mathematically, if Pin represents the total power input and Pout represents the power output in the desired form, then the efficiency E, as a ratio between 0 and 1, is given by:

E=P out /P in  Equation 1

If E % represents the efficiency as a percentage, then:

E %=100P out /P in  Equation 2

In general, a transducer is not 100% efficient and power is typically lost during the operation of the transducer in the form of heat. However, for a high-Q transducer, efficiency can approach 100% and heat generated by the transducer is minimized. A transducer is most efficient at specific frequency fc, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The transducer has the maximum power output at frequency fc.
When a transducer operates, the transducer heats up over time and the temperature of the transducer changes. As the temperature of the transducer changes, the resonant frequency will shift towards frequency ft, as illustrated in FIG. 3. This frequency shift decreases the efficiency of the transducer and, the power output from the transducer is significantly lower in the example of FIG. 3 as compared to the example of FIG. 2.
Transducer efficiency decreases due to changes in temperature of the transducer as a function of time. In addition, a change in temperature of the transducer will cause a frequency shift. The frequency shift changes as a function of increasing temperature of the transducer. A frequency shift decreases efficiency and can cause a system to change total power input to make up for a loss of power applied by the transducer. A frequency shift will change the impedance of the transducer.
In various embodiments, systems and methods, described herein, monitor transducer temperature and report changes in temperature to a controller to modify the frequency generation to the transducer. In various embodiments, systems and methods can monitor transducer temperature and report changes in temperature to a controller to modify the total power input to the transducer. In various embodiments, systems and methods can monitor efficiency and controls transducer temperature to prevent energy transmission from a shift in frequency.
In various embodiments, systems and methods can at least one of monitor transducer temperature and control transducer temperature. In various embodiments, systems and methods can operate the transducer to at or near maximum efficiency of power over a period of time. In various embodiments, systems and methods can operate the transducer to at or near maximum efficiency of power as a temperature of the transducer changes. In various embodiments, systems and methods can modify temperature of the transducer to maintain operation at or near maximum efficiency of power. In various embodiments, systems and methods can prevent a change in impedance of the transducer.
In some embodiments, energy emission, such as, an ultrasound emission, can be directed to targeted tissue to initiate a desired treatment to the targeted tissue. If the power of the energy emission, such as, an ultrasound emission, is too high, the targeted tissue can be permanently damaged, which provide pain to the patient being treated. In addition, if the power of the energy emission such as, an ultrasound emission, is too high, the desired treatment to the targeted tissue may not be effective. If the power of the energy emission, such as, an ultrasound emission, is too low, the desired treatment to the targeted tissue may not be effective.
If the efficiency of the transducer degrades, the power of energy emission decreases. If the temperature of the transducer changes, the efficiency of the transducer changes and the power of energy emission decreases. For the most effective treatment to targeted tissue, power of energy emission is constant. Various embodiments provide methods and systems to provide constant energy emission from transducer 110 that is directed to targeted tissue.
Referring to FIG. 4, system 131 is illustrated, in accordance with some embodiments. System 131 can comprise drivers 102, power sensor 104, transducer 110, controller 115, and oscillator 120. In various embodiments, oscillator 120 generates a frequency which is communicated to drivers 102 to power transducer 110 to produce energy transmission 150 at the frequency. Oscillator 120 can be an oscillator or any frequency generator, now known or later developed. For example, oscillator 120 can be but is not limited to, a function generator, a frequency generator, a waveform generator, a signal generator, pitch generator, a wave generator, or a pulse generator, frequency synthesizer, direct digital synthesizer, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, oscillator 120 can be combined with or integrated to drivers 102. In some embodiments, oscillator 120 is programmable. In some embodiments, controller 115 can be combined with or integrated to at least one of oscillator 120 and drivers 102. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 can be combined with or integrated to at least one of oscillator 120, controller 115 and drivers 102.

In some embodiments, power sensor 104 can be combined with or integrated to at least one of oscillator 120, and controller 115. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 can be combined with or integrated to drivers 102. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 can be combined with or integrated to oscillator 120. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 can be combined with or integrated to controller 115.
In some embodiments, power sensor 104 monitors power input from drivers 102 to transducer 110. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 communicates with controller 115, which controls oscillator 120. In some embodiments, controller 115 receives signal from power sensor 104 and controls a frequency generated by oscillator 120 based on the received signal. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 communicates a power level of the power input from drivers 102.
As transducer 110 efficiency of energy transmission 150 degrades, for example as illustrated in FIG. 3, drivers 102 changes the power input to transducer 110. In some embodiments, power sensor 104 detects the change in power input to transducer 110 and communicates with controller 115, which controls oscillator 120 to change in the power level of the power input from supply and/or drivers 102. In some embodiments, oscillator 120 generates a correction to the frequency which is communicated to the drivers 102, which is based on the communication from the power sensor 104. In some embodiments, the correction to the frequency lowers the power level of power input from drivers 102. In some embodiments, energy transmission 150 is corrected to specific frequency fc as illustrated in FIG. 2. If this correction to specific frequency fc does not lower the power input from the drivers 102 to transducer 110 below a threshold, power sensor 104 communicates this elevated power level to controller 115, which controls oscillator 120 for another generation of a correction to the frequency. In some embodiments, system 131 comprises a shut off power function, which is initiated if power sensor 104 detects a power level that is above a predetermined threshold, in some embodiments, the shut off power function prevents the damaging or destroying of transducer 110.
In some embodiments, the thickness of the transduction element of transducer 110 may be configured to be uniform. That is, the transduction element may be configured to have a thickness that is generally substantially the same throughout. In another exemplary embodiment, the transduction element may also be configured with a variable thickness, and/or as a multiple damped device. For example, the transduction element of transducer 110 may be configured to have a first thickness selected to provide a specific operating frequency of a lower range, for example from approximately 1 kHz to 3 MHz. The transduction element may also be configured with a second thickness selected to provide a specific operating frequency of a higher range, for example from approximately 3 to 100 MHz or other frequency ranges described herein.
In yet another exemplary embodiment, transducer 110 may be configured as a single broadband transducer excited with two or more frequencies to provide an adequate output for raising the temperature within ROI 215 to the desired level. Transducer 110 may also be configured as two or more individual transducers, wherein each transducer 110 may comprise a transduction element. The thickness of the transduction elements may be configured to provide specific-operating frequencies in a desired treatment range. For example, in some embodiments, transducer 110 may comprise a first transducer 110 configured with a first transduction element having a thickness corresponding to a specific frequency range of approximately 1 MHz to 3 MHz, and a second transducer 110 configured with a second transduction element having a thickness corresponding to a specific frequency of approximately 3 MHz to 100 MHz or frequency ranges described herein.
Moreover, in some embodiments, any variety of mechanical lenses or variable focus lenses, e.g. liquid-filled lenses, may also be used to focus and or defocus the energy field. For example, transducer 110 may also be configured with an electronic focusing array in combination with one or more transduction elements to facilitate changed flexibility in treating ROI 215. Array may be configured in a manner similar to transducer 110. That is, array may be configured as an array of electronic apertures that may be operated by a variety of phases via variable electronic time delays. Accordingly, the electronic apertures of array may be manipulated, driven, used, configured to produce and/or deliver energy in a manner corresponding to the phase variation caused by the electronic time delay. For example, these phase variations may be used to deliver defocused beams, planar beams, and/or focused beams, each of which may be used in combination to achieve different physiological effects in ROI 215.
Transduction elements may be configured to be concave, convex, and/or planar. For example, transduction elements can be configured to be concave in order to provide focused energy for treatment of ROI 215. In another exemplary embodiment, transduction elements may be configured to be substantially flat in order to provide substantially uniform energy to ROI 215. In addition, transduction elements may be configured to be any combination of concave, convex, and/or substantially flat structures. For example, a first transduction element may be configured to be concave, while a second transduction element may be configured to be substantially flat.
Moreover, transduction element can be any distance from the skin surface 204. In that regard, it can be far away from the skin surface 204 disposed within a long transducer 110 or it can be just a few millimeters from skin surface 204. In certain exemplary embodiments, positioning the transduction element closer to skin surface 204 is better for transmitting ultrasound at high frequencies. Moreover, both two and three dimensional arrays of transduction elements can be used in various embodiments.
In some embodiments, transducer 110 may also be configured as an annular array to provide planar, focused and/or defocused acoustical energy. For example, in some embodiments, an annular array may comprise a plurality of rings. Rings may be mechanically and electrically isolated into a set of individual elements, and may create planar, focused, or defocused waves. For example, such waves can be specified on-axis, such as by methods of adjusting corresponding phase delays. An electronic focus may be moved along various depth positions in ROI 215, and may enable variable strength or beam tightness, while an electronic defocus may have varying amounts of defocusing. In some embodiments, a lens and/or convex or concave shaped annular array may also be provided to aid focusing or defocusing such that any time differential delays can be reduced. Movement of annular array in one, two or three-dimensions, or along any path, such as through use of probes, motion mechanisms, any conventional robotic arm mechanisms, and the like may be implemented to scan and/or treat a volume or any corresponding space within ROI 215.

BACKGROUND
A variety of methods and systems and methods exist to treat tissue, including mechanical means, lasers and other photon-based sources, radio frequency (RF) electrical currents, microwaves, cryogenic based techniques, and their various combinations, among others.
Each of these modalities has limitations which prevent a high degree of spatial control and precision during treatment. For example, in tissue the extreme absorption and scattering of photons relegates light based therapies to superficial applications that are tissue specific. Typically, electric currents, such as those emitted from a RF source, flow along the path of least impedance and are diffuse and non-selective, with maximum effect to tissue at the source. Further, the centimeter wavelengths of microwaves preclude tight focusing and energy placement in tissue.
Ultrasound can provide depth and precision of energy placement in tissue; however, it has currently been limited in application to either broad planar sources such as used in physiotherapy treatment, or as a single beam of focused sound, which is scanned sequentially over numerous areas, either electronically or mechanically, which is slow. Array based systems which can produce multiple sound beams are cumbersome and expensive and cannot in general produce output energy with a high degree of control or flexibility.
What is needed is an ultrasound treatment method and system that can provide simultaneous multiple beams of controlled energy to produce fractionated intense energy effects, such as thermal effects.
SUMMARY
Methods and systems for ultrasound treatment are provided. Acoustic energy, including ultrasound, under proper functional control can penetrate deeply and be controlled precisely in tissue. In various embodiments, methods and systems can be configured for ultrasound treatment based on creating an input energy distribution, passing it through apertures in a mask, which act in parallel as secondary acoustic sources to create an output distribution function. In various embodiments, methods and systems can be configured to create and control a desired temperature distribution.
Some embodiments provide an ultrasound treatment system configured for temporarily or permanently affecting tissue or its physiology. The ultrasound treatment system can comprise an energy source configured for delivery of acoustic or other energy to a treatment region; a control system for facilitating control of the energy source; and a set of masks, apertures, mask components, input/output, and secondary systems in communication with the control system to define a spatio-temporal distribution of the energy in the treatment region.
Some embodiments provide a method for providing ultrasound treatment. The method can comprise localizing a treatment region; delivering acoustic energy from an energy source into the treatment region; controlling the delivery of acoustic energy; producing at least one treatment effect in the treatment region of interest with the delivering acoustic energy. The method can further comprise monitoring of results of the ultrasound treatment during and/or after of the delivery of acoustic energy.

In various embodiments at least one of treatment effect 302 can intersect in the treatment region 114.
Various embodiments of masks 108 and apertures 110 are illustrated in FIG. 4. Aperture 110A illustrates a large opening or mesh-like mask 108, while in contrast aperture 110B is more closed, with smaller apertures 110. In various embodiments the relative acoustic spacing between adjacent apertures 110 determines if their output energy 112 combines partially or fully in the treatment region 114 or can be considered as independent sound fields. In some embodiments, apertures 1100 are placed in a random spatial pattern, within bounds, as opposed to a rectilinear or other periodic pattern, and can used to obscure potential treatment side effects, such as temporary edema or erythema on the surface of skin. In various embodiments, mask 108 has multiple sized or shaped apertures, such as apertures 110D and 110D′ which can create multiple patterns of output energy 112 in the treatment region 114. In various embodiments, at least two different diameter or sized apertures 110D and 110D′ create two different depths of treatment. In various embodiments, at least two different diameter or sized apertures 1101 and 1101D″ create two different sized treatment regions. In various embodiments, mask 108 can consist of a line of apertures 110E or multi-dimensional apertures 110F, such as slots, which can produce different field patterns of output energy 112 along different axes. In various embodiments, mask 402 can be split into more than one zone and secondary systems 150, can be integrated, such as a transducer for an ultrasound imaging and monitoring system. In various embodiments, transducer can be configured in-line along mask 402 or transverse or along the center of a mask 404.
According to various embodiments as illustrated in FIG. 5, the primary energy source 102 is a spherically focused or lensed ultrasound source, which concentrates acoustic input energy 104 emitted from a large surface area (e.g. a spherical shell) through an enclosed coupling, medium 106, such as water, onto a mask 108, such as a stainless steel mask, and through apertures 110, to create a pattern of output energy 112 in the treatment region 114. In such embodiments, the level of output energy 112 can be made very intense, even if emitted from a small aperture 110, and such intense sound levels can be exploited in the treatment region 114 for treatment effects 302 such as thermal effects. Such embodiments illustrate that even if the aperture 108 is physically small or acoustically small a large amount of power can be emitted at the aperture 110. Such large power output may not be easily deliverable if a single active transducer element was disposed at aperture 110. In various embodiments, a fluid coupling medium 106 can be held above atmospheric pressure or consist of a material that can avoid cavitation. In various embodiments, a fluid reservoir can be used to maintain the level of coupling medium 106. Various embodiments may be used to output fluid coupling medium 106 to provide external acoustic coupling to treatment region 114.
According to various embodiments and with reference to FIG. 6, the primary energy source is a cylindrically focused ultrasound source, which concentrates acoustic input energy 104 emitted from a large surface area (e.g. cylindrical shell) onto a mask 108 and through apertures 110, to create a pattern of output energy 112 in the treatment region 114. In various embodiments, the primary energy source is a phased array, including phase variation and/or beam steering, and including beamforming over the mask 108 and apertures 110.
According to various embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 7, a primary energy source focuses an incident acoustic input energy 104 onto a mask 108, and a portion of such incident acoustic energy 104 is reflected back by such mask 108 as reflected input energy 104′ which is then absorbed by an absorber 702. In one embodiment, an opening in the primary energy source can allow the reflected input energy 104′ to pass through. In another embodiment, the absorber 702 is on the surface of or in front of the source. In another embodiment the primary source is electrically isolated where the reflected energy impinges on it, such electrically isolated region electronically damped by a network including a resistor, in another embodiment, opening in primary energy source 102 includes plastic tubing which absorbs and attenuates sound while serving as a liquid coupling fluid hydraulic control.
Moving to FIG. 8, a mathematical relationship 802 encapsulates the ultrasound treatment system as a spatio-temporal input energy 104 distribution function (x, y, z, t), which is modulated by a spatio-temporal aperture 110 mask 108 function M(x, v, z, t) to create a spatio-temporal output energy 112 distribution function (x, y, z, t). As such, any acoustic field distribution and timing can be synthesized for the output energy function 112. Of note, in various embodiments mask surface can be three-dimensional and/or time varying.
    In various embodiments, ultrasound treatment system 100 is an entire system capable of at least one of treating, imaging, or monitoring, before, during and after treatment, using at least one of acoustic energy and any other energy source, including for example laser, photon emission, and, or radio frequency energy. In one embodiment, ultrasound treatment system 100 comprises acoustic primary energy source 102, control system 130, and at least one other energy source, all encompassed in one unit.
Various embodiments provide a method for providing ultrasound treatment. The method can comprise localizing a treatment region 114, choosing a primary energy source 102, delivering acoustic input energy 104 from the primary energy source 102 through the mask 108 apertures 110 and into the treatment region 114, and controlling the output energy 112 to produce at least one treatment effect 302 in the treatment region 114. The method can further comprise monitoring of results of the ultrasound treatment during and/or after of the delivery of acoustic output energy 112. The method can further comprise planning of additional treatment. In some embodiments, the method is a method of cosmetic enhancement.
The method can comprise providing at least one bio-effect in the in at least one treatment region 114. The method can comprise destroying tissue in the at least one treatment region 114. The method can further comprise generating at least one biological effect in tissue proximate to the at least one treatment region 114. Control of one or more parameters of the output energy 112, defines the explicit shape of the treatment region 114 to affect ultrasound treatment. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, output energy 112 can be employed in any method and/or system described herein. It should be appreciated that designated treatment effect 302 has a conformal volume that can be spatially and temporally controlled by ultrasound treatment system 100 and expanded in one or more conformal volumes. Such effect will produce one or more distinct zones of controlled and predictable parameters and dimensions by either electronic and/or mechanical displacements of the acoustic primary energy source, 102 and associated components, mask 108, etc.
As used herein, the term cosmetic enhancement can refer to procedures, which are not medically necessary and are used to improve or change the appearance of a portion of the body. For example, a cosmetic enhancement can be a procedure that is used to improve or change the appearance of a nose, eyes, eyebrows and/or other facial features, or to improve or change the appearance and/or the texture and/or the elasticity of skin, or to improve or change the appearance of a mark or scar on a skin surface, or to improve or change the appearance and/or the content of fat near a skin surface, or the targeting of a gland to improve or change the appearance a portion of the body. Since it is not medically indicated for improving one's physical well-being, cosmetic enhancement is an elective procedure. As used herein, cosmetic enhancement does not diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure a disease or other medical condition. Furthermore, cosmetic enhancement is not a method for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body. Cosmetic enhancement is a non-surgical and non-invasive procedure. In some embodiments, cosmetic enhancement can be a non-surgical and non-invasive procedure that is performed at home by a user who is not a medical professional.

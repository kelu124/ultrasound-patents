BACKGROUND
In modern digital systems, digital information has to be processed in a reliable and efficient way. In this context, digital information is to be understood as information available in discrete, i.e., discontinuous values. Bits, collection of bits, but also numbers from a finite set can be used to represent digital information.
In most chip-to-chip, or device-to-device communication systems, communication takes place over a plurality of wires to increase the aggregate bandwidth. A single or pair of these wires may be referred to as a channel or link and multiple channels create a communication bus between the electronic components. At the physical circuitry level, in chip-to-chip communication systems, buses are typically made of electrical conductors in the package between chips and motherboards, on printed circuit boards (“PCBs”) boards or in cables and connectors between PCBs. In high frequency applications, microstrip or stripline PCB traces may be used.
Common methods for transmitting signals over bus wires include single-ended and differential signaling methods. In applications requiring high speed communications, those methods can be further optimized in terms of power consumption and pin-efficiency, especially in high-speed communications. More recently, vector-signaling methods have been proposed to further optimize the trade-offs between power consumption, pin efficiency and noise robustness of chip-to-chip communication systems. In those vector signaling systems, the digital information is transformed into a different representation space in the form of a vector codeword that is chosen in order to optimize the power consumption, pin-efficiency and speed trade-offs based on the transmission channel properties and communication system design constraints. Herein, this process is referred to as “encoding”. At the receiver side, the received signals corresponding to the codeword are transformed back into the original digital information representation space. Herein, this process is referred to as “decoding”.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION
Methods and systems are described for obtaining a set of information signals and responsively generating symbols of a multi-level vector signaling codeword, the multi-level vector signaling codeword representing a sum of a plurality of orthogonal sub-channel vectors, each sub-channel vector having an associated weight determined by a corresponding information signal, and transmitting the symbols of the codeword over a multi-wire skew-balanced channel, the multi-wire skew-balanced channel having (i) a plurality of conductors, each conductor for carrying a respective symbol of the multi-level vector signaling codeword and (ii) at least first and second dielectric materials interposed between the plurality conductors to offset coupling mismatches associated with geometric mismatches between the plurality of conductors.
In some embodiments, a multi-wire skew-balanced channel include a first dielectric material having a plurality of embedded conductors of a multi-wire channel, the plurality of embedded conductors comprising at least a first, second and third conductor, wherein a first distance between the first and second conductors is less than a second distance between the first and third conductors, wherein the first dielectric material has a first dielectric constant ε1 and a second dielectric material embedded in the first dielectric material, the second dielectric material embedded in between the first and third conductors, the second dielectric material having a second dielectric constant ε2, wherein ε2>ε1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Embodiments are described herein for reducing skew in a multi-wire channel by adjusting signal propagation speed through the use of dielectric materials. In vector signaling embodiments, wire skew and a capacitive coupling mismatch for a given chord of three or more symbols may be introduced if there are varying distances between any three wires. Correcting for skew in vector signaling may improve performance as each conductor is carrying a symbol of the chord, rather than being part of a differential pair. By matching the capacitive coupling between the conductors, the skew between the symbols of the chord may be reduced, providing more accurate and reliable detection of encoded data. FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate an exemplary four-wire channel. As shown, FIG. 1A includes a first dielectric material 105 having a dielectric constant ε1, and four signal conductors 110. The signal conductors may pass through the dielectric material 105, as shown in FIG. 1B. In some embodiments, dielectric material 105 may be a cavity of air (enclosed by a plastic housing, for example), or various other gases having various possible dielectric constants ε. Alternatively, the dielectric material 105 may be a solid material, such as plastic, or any other dielectric materials known to those of skill in the art.
As shown in FIG. 1A, the distance between conductor 1 and adjacent conductor 2 is d12, while the distance between conductor 1 and diagonal conductor 3 is d13. It is evident in FIG. 1A that d12<d13. As known to those of skill in the art, the velocity factor (VF; the ratio of the speed at which a waveform passes through a medium to the speed of light in a vacuum) is inversely proportional to the square root of the dielectric constant k, as shown below in Eqn. 1:







VF
=

k

However, it can also be shown that VF may be related to the capacitance C between conductors:

(

where L is the distributed inductance, C is the capacitance between the conductors, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Further, as capacitance between two conductors is inversely proportional to the distance d between them:

(

where d is the distance between the conductors and a is the area of the of the cross-section of the conductors, then the capacitance C12 between conductors 1 and 2 will be larger than the capacitance C13 between conductors 1 and 3 when d12<d13. Following this observation, it can be derived that the velocity factor between conductors 1 and 2 (denoted VF12) will be less than the VF13 between conductors 1 and 3. Such a difference in capacitive coupling and VF may cause skew to appear at the end of the channel, and may result in the symbols of the vector signaling codeword to be received at the end of the channel at skewed times. By equalizing the capacitive coupling such that C12=C13, the skew at the end of the channel may be reduced, among other beneficial transmission characteristics.
In some embodiments, skew is introduced due to geometric mismatches regarding the conductors. In some embodiments, the geometric mismatches may correspond to varying distances between pairs of conductors, surface areas of the cross sections of conductors, or various other aspects regarding the design/layout of the multi-wire channel. In some embodiments, the skew introduced by such geometric mismatches may be offset by equalizing capacitive coupling between all conductors in the channel. In some embodiments, equalizing the capacitive coupling can be done by inserting a second dielectric material having a dielectric constant of ε2 in between conductors 1 and 3, where ε2>ε1, which will offset the mismatch caused by the geometric (i.e., spatial distance) mismatch. By selecting a dielectric material having a dielectric constant ε2, VF13 may be reduced until VF13=VF12, according to Eqn. 1 above. Alternatively, ε2 may be fixed, while the dielectric material 105 is selected to have a ε1 that is less than ε2, thus increasing VF12 until it is equal to VF13. FIG. 2 illustrates an example skew-tolerant four-wire channel, in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, FIG. 2 is similar to the four-wire channel shown in FIG. 1A, with the addition of the dielectric material 205 having dielectric constant ε2 inserted into the middle of dielectric material ε1. As one will observe, the dielectric constant between conductors 1 and 2 remains ε1, while the effective dielectric constant between conductors 1 and 3 is a combination of ε1 and ε2. In some embodiments, the effective combination may be tuned (e.g., adjusting the capacitance seen between conductors) until VF13=VF12, for instance, by selecting a material having a larger or smaller relative dielectric constant ε2. Alternatively, a diameter of dielectric material 205 may be adjusted in order to tune the effective combination of ε1 and ε2. It should be noted that although dielectric material 205 is shown as a cylinder, this should not be considered limiting, and tuning the effective combination of ε1 and ε2 may include adjusting other size parameters such as width or length, if a square/rectangle is used, for example.
 FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate skew-tolerant four-wire channels having various lengths, in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, the four signal conductors as well as dielectric material 205 penetrate fully through dielectric material 105. FIG. 3B shows the length l of the channel being approximately equal to the width w, while FIG. 3A shows the length l being shorter than width w. In some embodiments, the l and w are on the order of millimeters. In such embodiments, the channel may be used as a connector between 2 printed circuit boards (PCBs), as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, and described below. In some embodiments, the above-described method may also be applied to a channel taking the form of a cable, in which case l>>w.
 FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary connection interface, in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, the skew-tolerant channel 404 is attached to PCB1, which may be a computer motherboard, without implying limitation. PCB2 (which may be a graphics processing unit or memory device, without implying limitation) is shown to have a connector 412 attached, including pins 420. In some embodiments, the pins 420 act as the signal conductors, and are inserted into holes 416, and make direct contact with PCB1's pads (or contacts) 408. In some embodiments, holes 416 may include conducting sleeves, which may be soldered to contacts 408, while the conducting sleeves maintain a connection to pins 420. FIG. 4B illustrates an alternative connection interface, in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 4B is similar to FIG. 4A, except that skew-tolerant channel 404 includes conducting material in holes 416, and connector 412 on PCB2 includes short pins that make a direct contact to the conducting material in hole 416.
The above examples describe a simple case of a multi-wire skew-balanced channel, however such embodiments should not be considered limiting. FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary six-wire channel. As shown in FIG. 5, there are three different distances: d12<d13<d14. Using similar techniques described above, the signal propagation speed (or velocity factors) between conductors 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 may be matched by including additional dielectric materials. FIG. 6 illustrates a skew-tolerant six-wire channel, in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, FIG. 6 includes a first dielectric material 105 having dielectric constant ε1, a second dielectric material 205 having dielectric constant ε2, and a third dielectric material 605 having dielectric constant ε3. Following the above procedures, it may be derived that ε3>ε2>ε1. As shown in FIG. 6, the coupling between conductors 1 and 2 is affected by only the first dielectric material 105, the coupling between conductors 1 and 3 is affected by the first and second dielectric materials 105 and 205, respectively, while the coupling between conductors 1 and 4 is affected by the first, second and third dielectric materials 105, 205, and 605, respectively. Thus, each of the dielectric materials may be tuned to achieve equal mutual capacitance between any pair of wires, and to achieve equal VFs between each pair of conductors using techniques described above.
In some embodiments, for n wires arranged in a regular n-gon, a number of different distances k is equal to floor(n/2), where floor(x) is the largest integer <=x. In some embodiments, k concentric circles of dielectric materials having dielectric constant εm may be inserted into the n-gon such that the direct line between a vertex v and a vertex w passes through the k-th inter circle if the distance between v and w is the (k+1)-th smallest distance, where k is an integer 0<k<floor(n/2)−1, and does not pass through the (k+1)-th inner circle. FIGS. 7A-7D depicts various n-gons including a square (n=4), a pentagon (n=5), a hexagon (n=6) and an octagon (n=8), respectively. It should also be noted that embodiments described above have points representing vertices on a circle, however in alternative embodiments, this may not be the case. In such embodiments, the shape of the dielectrics may be adjusted, as shown in FIG. 7E, where the conductors are vertices on a rectangle. Other possible shapes the conductors may be arranged in may include trapezoids, ovals, and triangles, as well as any other shapes known to those of skill in the art.
In some embodiments, a skew-balanced bus as described above may be equipped with (or connected to) a transceiver configured to encode received information signals into codewords of a vector signaling code. In some embodiments, the transceiver may be adapted to receive information bits from a first type of interface (USB-C) or similar interfaces having a prior art signaling scheme, such as non-return to zero (NRZ), and may convert the received information bits to multi-level vector signaling codewords for transmission. Further, a cable incorporating a skew-balanced bus as described above may include a single transceiver at one end of the cable, or alternatively at each end of the cable may include a transceiver.
 FIG. 8 is a block diagram of a system comprised of a transmitting device, interconnection, and receiving device. The data source may be a host computing device, or an adapter or transceiver supporting another interface type. The data sink may also be a host computing device, or an adapter or transceiver supporting another interface type. As a non-limiting example, FIG. 8 shows the Data Source co-located with the transmitter within the transmitting device, and the data sink co-located with the receiver within the receiving device.
 FIG. 9 illustrates one embodiment of a transmitting device utilizing multiple processing phases for H4 (also referred to as ENRZ) encoding. As described by [Fox I], the H4 vector signaling code encodes three data bits for transmission over four wires. At very high communication rates, multiple instances of such encoders may execute essentially in parallel as distinct processing phases of a multi-phase encoder. At lower data rates, a single processing instance may suffice. In some embodiments, a skew-balanced multi-wire bus may include a transceiver having the components or a subset of the components of the transmitting device of FIG. 9.
 FIG. 10A illustrates one embodiment of a receiving device. [Fox I] also describes use of multi-input comparators (MIC) as vector signaling code decoders. Each H4 decoding MIC is comprised of two summation elements 1021, and one difference or comparison element 1022. Three MICS are sufficient 1020 to fully decode the three received bits 1025 of the H4 code. As with the previously described transmitter, multiple processing phases may be applied to the receiver to support very high communication rates. FIG. 10B shows additional details of an embodiment utilizing multiple processing phases 1020 for H4 decoding. Lower communication rates may be supported by fewer, or a single processing phase. In some embodiments, a skew-balanced multi-wire bus may include a transceiver having the components or a subset of the components of the receiving device of FIG. 9.
CNRZ-5 is another vector signaling code designed to communicate five bits over six wires, as described by [Hormati I]. FIG. 11 is a block diagram of a system utilizing the CNRZ-5 code for communication between transmitter 1110 and receiver 1130 via multiple wires. As in FIG. 8, data source S0-S4 and data sink R0-R4 may be host computing devices, or adapters or transceivers supporting another interface type. In some embodiments, transmitters may be co-located with data sources, and receivers may be are co-located with data sinks.
 FIG. 12 shows one embodiment of a CNRZ-5 receiver, in which received signals S0-S4 are decoded directly from received wire signals w0-w5 using weighted multi-input comparators. As described by [Hormati I] five weighted input multi-input comparators fully decode a CNRZ-5 vector signaling code.
 FIG. 13 shows another embodiment of a CNRZ-5 receiver, in which received signals S0-S4 are decoded directly from received wire signals w0-w5 using weighted multi-input comparators, and data signals S0-S3 are then latched by a strobe signal communicated via signal S4.
 FIG. 14 is a flowchart of a method 1400, in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, method 1400 includes obtaining 1402 a set of information signals and responsively generating 1404 symbols of a multi-level vector signaling codeword, the multi-level vector signaling codeword representing a sum of a plurality of orthogonal sub-channel vectors, each sub-channel vector having an associated weight determined by a corresponding information signal. At 1406, the symbols of the codeword are transmitted over a multi-wire skew-balanced channel, the multi-wire skew-balanced channel having (i) a plurality of conductors, each conductor for carrying a respective symbol of the multi-level vector signaling codeword and (ii) at least first and second dielectric materials interposed between the plurality conductors to offset coupling mismatches associated with geometric mismatches between the plurality of conductors.
The examples presented herein illustrate the use of vector signaling codes for point-to-point wire communications. For purposes of explanation, interconnection between a first transmitting device and a second receiving device have been described as unidirectional signaling networks. However, this should not been seen in any way as limiting the scope of the described invention. The methods disclosed in this application are equally applicable to networks capable of alternating signaling direction (i.e. half duplex), or of providing simultaneous communication between separate transmitters and receivers in both directions (i.e. full duplex.) Similarly, more than one instance of the described invention may be used essentially in parallel to communicate wider data words and/or provide higher overall communication bandwidth, with individual instances having individual embedded clocks, or two or more instances sharing a common clock. Other communication media including optical and wireless communications may similarly be used rather than the described wire interconnections. Thus, descriptive terms herein such as “voltage” or “signal level” should be considered to include equivalents in other measurement systems, such as “optical intensity”, “RF modulation”, etc. As used herein, the term “physical signal” includes any suitable behavior and/or attribute of a physical phenomenon capable of conveying information. Physical signals may be tangible and non-transitory.

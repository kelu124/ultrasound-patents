BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
   The present invention relates to an ultrasonic probe and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, and more particularly, to an ultrasonic probe and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus having a cooling system.
 2. Description of the Related Art
   An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus for examining an object by transmitting ultrasonic waves to the object so as to use the reflected waves has been widely used in a medical field. An ultrasonic probe for transmitting/receiving ultrasonic waves is used by bringing its leading end in contact with the object, and the ultrasonic probe includes a plurality of transducers which generate ultrasonic waves while converting received ultrasonic waves into electric signals.
    During operation of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, not all the ultrasonic waves generated in the ultrasonic probe transmitting ultrasonic waves are transmitted to the object and part of them is absorbed in the transducers and converted into heat. When a circuit of a transmission/reception part for generating drive signals of ultrasonic waves and processing the received ultrasonic signals from the transducers in an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core connected to the ultrasonic probe is housed in the ultrasonic probe, electric power is consumed also in the circuit so as to generate heat.
    The ultrasonic probe, as mentioned above, is used by bringing it in contact with a body surface of the object, it is necessary to design the ultrasonic probe so that the surface temperature does not exceed a predetermined temperature for its safety sake.
    On the other hand, there is a method for improving the quality of ultrasonic images by increasing the power of transmitting ultrasonic waves so as to increase the S/N (signal to noise) ratio of the received ultrasonic waves. Although the power of transmitting ultrasonic waves has an upper limit for its safety, with increasing S/N ratio within a safe range, the larger S/N ratio can be obtained so as to improve the image quality.
    However, if the power of transmitting ultrasonic waves is increased, the heat value in the ultrasonic probe is also increased so as to largely increase the surface temperature of the probe, thereby giving the object discomfort.
    Recently, an ultrasonic probe capable of three-dimensional scanning has been developed, which includes two-dimensionally arranged transducers so as to three-dimensionally apply ultrasonic waves, and it has begun limited practical operations. In such an ultrasonic probe capable of three-dimensional scanning, the number of transducers increases in comparison with that of an ultrasonic probe capable of two-dimensional scanning in that transducers are unitarily arranged, so that when the circuit of the transmission/reception part in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core is built in the probe, the scale of the circuit also becomes large.
    Accordingly, in the ultrasonic probe capable of three-dimensional scanning, with increasing number of transducers and with increasing circuit scale, the heat value is increased, so that it is difficult to maintain the surface temperature at its front end lower than a predetermined level.
    Then, an ultrasonic probe having a cooling mechanism using a refrigerant such as water has been proposed (see, for example, United States Patent No. 5,560,362 or Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No.2003-38485). The proposed ultrasonic probe has a structure in that a refrigerant is circulated between an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core and the front end of the ultrasonic probe via a refrigerant tube attached to a cable of the ultrasonic probe so as to cool the ultrasonic probe. A cooling system, including a pump for passing the refrigerant to the ultrasonic probe and a radiator for cooling the refrigerant, is housed in a probe connector part connecting between the ultrasonic probe and the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core or in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core.
    Fig. 29 is a diagram showing an example of a structure of a conventional ultrasonic probe having a cooling mechanism. This ultrasonic probe 100 includes a probe unit 110, a compound cable unit 120 and a connector part 130. The probe unit 110 has a transducer part 111 and a heat- receiving part 112. The transducer part 111 transmits and receives ultrasonic waves to and from an object. The heat-receiving part 112 absorbs heat of the transducer part 111. The compound cable unit 120 communicates ultrasonic driving signals to the transducer part 111 and ultrasonic reception signals from the transducer part 111. The connector part 130 connects the compound cable unit 120 and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 200.
    Fig. 30 is a diagram showing a section of the conventional compound cable unit 120 shown in Fig. 29. The compound cable unit 120 includes a multi-core cable 121, a refrigerant supply tube 122, a refrigerant ejection tube 123 and a coating 125. The multi-core cable 121 has signal lines 124 which communicate signals between the probe unit 110 and the connector part 130. The refrigerant supply tube 122 serves as a channel supplying a refrigerant cooled in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 200 to the heat-receiving part 112 of the probe unit 110 through the connector part 130. The refrigerant ejection tube 123 serves as a channel sending the refrigerant ejected from the heat-receiving part 112 to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 200 through the connector part 130. The coating 125 sticks and bundles the multi-core cable 121 in which each core has a circular section, the refrigerant supply tube 122 and the refrigerant ejection tube 123.
    The compound cable unit 120 of the ultrasonic probe 100 having the cooling mechanism includes the refrigerant supply tube 122 and the refrigerant ejection tube 123 closely arranged outside the multi-core cable 121. Hence, due to the heat from the refrigerant ejection tube 123 for sending the refrigerant ejecting the heat of the heat-receiving part 112, the temperature of the refrigerant in the refrigerant supply tube 122 rises so as to reduce the cooling power of the heat-receiving part 112.
    In the geometrical moment of inertia of the compound cable unit 120, as shown in Fig. 30, the geometrical moment of inertia about an axis XX of the length h in the moment direction (the diameter of the multi-core cable 121 + a diameter close to that of the refrigerant supply tube 122 or the refrigerant ejection tube 123) is larger than those about axes YY, Y1Y1, and Y2Y2 of a length W in the moment direction close to the diameter of the multi-core cable 121, so that directional difference in bending easiness of the compound cable unit 120 is produced, deteriorating operationality of the ultrasonic probe.
    On the other hand, in the ultrasonic probe housing a number of transducers or a number of transducers and a circuit board, the temperature of not only the front end of a probe unit but also of the entire probe unit is increased, so that a safety problem in handling the probe unit arises for an operator of the ultrasonic probe who gets hold it directly with a hand. Since the probe unit is provided with a endothirm part for absorbing the heat, the ultrasonic probe is increased in size, deteriorating the operationality.
    When the cooling system is also assembled within the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core, it is necessary to circulate a refrigerant via a probe connector part, so that the cost of a connection mechanism for the refrigerant in between the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core and the probe connector part is increased while reliability in cooling power is difficult to be secured.
    Furthermore, when a cooling system using a refrigerant is assembled within the ultrasonic probe including the probe connector part, since the space within the ultrasonic probe is small, it is difficult to achieve a cooling system with sufficient cooling power while securing reliability in cooling power.
    In order to improve the cooling power, it is necessary to increase a radiator for radiating the heat of a refrigerant so as to cool the refrigerant. When a pump for circulating the refrigerant, the radiator, and a container for storing the refrigerant are housed within the probe connector part, the probe connector part is increased in size by the size of the large radiator. The pump for circulating the refrigerant, the radiator for radiating the heat of the refrigerant, and a radiator fan need to be built in the probe connector part, thereby also increasing the probe connector part in size. When increasing the cooling power in such a manner, the cooling system becomes large in size, so that it has been difficult to simultaneously satisfy the improvement of the cooling power and the miniaturizing the cooling system.
    When cooling the ultrasonic probe by a cooling system incorporating the conventional technique, even when the temperature of the probe unit is not increased yet, the ultrasonic probe is cooled more than it needs, reducing energy efficiency.

    An ultrasonic probe 10 includes a probe unit 1, a cable unit 2 and a connector unit 3. The probe unit 1 transmits and receives ultrasonic waves to and from an object P. The cable unit 2 communicates signals for generating ultrasonic waves to the probe unit 1 and signals form the probe unit 1. The connector unit 3 which is detachable communicates signals for generating ultrasonic waves from an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20 to the cable unit 2 and signals from the cable unit 2 to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20.
    The probe unit 1 includes a transducer part 11, a transmission/reception part 12 and a heat receiving part 13. The transducer part 11 transmits ultrasonic waves to the object P and receives reflected waves from the object P. The transmission/reception part 12 performs processing to a signal from the cable unit 2 so as to generate an ultrasonic driving signal and performs processing to an ultrasonic reception signal from the transducer part 11. The heat receiving part 13 cools the transducer part 11 and the transmission/reception part 12.
    The transducer part 11 includes a plurality (N pieces) of piezoelectric transducers, each made of an electro-acoustic transducer including a piezoelectric high-polymer material and a piezoelectric ceramics. The transducer part 11 converts an ultrasonic drive signal from a transmission circuit of the transmission/reception part 12 into a transmission ultrasonic wave during the transmitting of ultrasonic waves while converting the received ultrasonic wave into an ultrasonic reception signal during the receiving of ultrasonic waves.
    The transmission/reception part 12 has a transmission circuit for generating the ultrasonic driving signal which allows the transducer part 11 to generate a transmission ultrasonic wave. The transducer part 11 includes a type capable of three-dimensional scanning for electronically applying an ultrasonic beam in a two- or three-dimensional direction by dividing the piezoelectric transducers to be two-dimensionally arranged and another type capable of two-dimensional scanning for electronically applying an ultrasonic beam in a two-dimensional direction by dividing the piezoelectric transducers to be single-dimensionally arranged. A case using the transducer part 11 capable of three-dimensional scanning will be described below.

The signal lines 21 transmit signals corresponding to the piezoelectric transducers of the transducer part 11 from the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20 to the transmission/reception part 12 of the probe unit 1 as well as ultrasonic reception signals corresponding to the piezoelectric transducers of the transducer part 11 from the transmission/reception part 12 to the connector unit 3.
    The refrigerant tube unit 22 includes a refrigerant supply tube 23, a refrigerant ejection tube 24 and a heat insulator 25.

The heat insulator 25 is arranged around the refrigerant supply tube 23.
    The connector unit 3 includes a connection part 31 and a refrigeration unit 32. The connection part 31 communicates ultrasonic reception signals from the signal lines 21 of the cable unit 2 to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20. The refrigeration unit 32 has a cooler 33 and a pump 34. The cooler 33 cools a refrigerant. The refrigeration unit 32 circulates a refrigerant in the ultrasonic probe 10.
    One and of the connection part 31 is connected to the signal lines 21 of the cable unit 2 while the other end of it is detachably connected to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20. The connection part 31 communicates signals for generating ultrasonic waves from the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20 to the cable unit 2 as well as ultrasonic reception signals from the cable unit 2 to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20.
    One end of the cooler 33 having a fan and a radiator is connected to the refrigerant supply tube 23 of the cable unit 2 via the pump 34 while the other end is connected to the heat receiving part 13 of the probe unit 1 via the refrigerant ejection tube 24 of the cable unit 2.
    A refrigerant on ejecting from the heat receiving part 13 returns to the refrigeration unit 32 via the refrigerant ejection tube 24 while a refrigerant on supplying, cooled in the refrigeration unit 32, is fed to the heat receiving part 13 via the refrigerant supply tube 23
    The powers for driving the refrigeration unit 32 and the pump 34 are supplied from the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 20.
    Then, a structure of the cable unit 2 will be described with reference to Fig. 2. Fig. 2 is a diagram showing an example of a section of the cable unit shown in Fig. 1. The cable unit 2 has a circular section. The refrigerant tube unit 22 is arranged in the vicinity of the center on the circular section. The signal lines 21 are arranged in and around the refrigerant tube unit 22. A shield 26 shields the signal lines 21. A coating 27 coats the shield 26 for insulating and protection.
    The refrigerant tube unit 22 has a substantially circular section. The refrigerant tube unit 22 has the refrigerant supply tube 23, the refrigerant ejection tube 24 and the heat insulator 25. The refrigerant ejection tube 24 is close to the refrigerant supply tube 23. The heat insulator 25 is arranged around the refrigerant supply tube 23. The heat insulator 25 may contact with the refrigerant ejection tube 24 due to bent operation of the cable unit 2.
    The refrigerant supply tube 23 and the refrigerant ejection tube 24 are made of a flexible material such as silicone rubber or a soft vinyl chloride resin.

    Then, a modified example of the cable unit will be described with reference to Fig. 3. Fig. 3 is a sectional view showing a modified example of the cable unit shown in Fig. 1. The point of a cable unit 2a shown in Fig. 3 differing from the cable unit 2 shown in Fig. 2 is that two circular cross-sectional refrigerant supply tubes and two circular cross-sectional refrigerant ejection tubes are provided.
    Refrigerant supply tubes 23a and refrigerant ejection tubes 24a of a refrigerant tube unit 22a, each being circular with the same outer and inner diameters, are arranged in the vicinity of the center of a cable unit 2a in contiguity with each other.

By discharging the refrigerant with the pump 75, the refrigerant is fed to the heat receiving part 73 in the probe unit 72 from the probe connector part 74 via the refrigerant tube 77a. The heat receiving part 73 absorbs the heat generated in the probe unit 72 (the heat generated in the piezoelectric transducer, for example) so as to conduct it to the refrigerant. By the heat conduction from the heat receiving part 73 to the refrigerant in such a manner, the temperature of the probe unit 72 is decreased. On the other hand, by receiving the heat from the heat receiving part 73, the temperature of the refrigerant is increased.
    By sucking the refrigerant with the pump 75, the refrigerant is sucked to the probe connector part 74 from the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77b. The refrigerant sucked by the pump 75 is delivered to the radiator 76 in the probe connector part 74. With the radiator 76, the heat of the refrigerant is radiated outside so as to cool the refrigerant, and the refrigerant is again discharged to the probe unit 72 by the refrigerant with the pump 75. By repeating this series of processes, the probe unit 72 is cooled.
    Now, a detailed structure of the probe connector part 74 will be described with reference to Figs. 15 to 17. Fig. 15 is a front view of the probe connector part 74 shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 16 is a sectional view of the probe connector part 74 along the line segment B-B' shown in Fig. 15. Fig. 17 is a sectional view of the probe connector part 74 along the line segment C-C' shown in Fig. 15.
    As shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the probe connector part 74 includes a feed pump 75a for feeding the refrigerant to the probe unit 72 and a suction pump 75b for sucking the refrigerant from the probe unit 72 arranged within the connector case 82. Furthermore, the probe connector part 74 includes the radiator 76 for cooling the refrigerant. According to the ninth embodiment, both the feed pump 75a and the suction pump 75b are provided; alternatively, with one pump, the refrigerant may be fed/sucked.
    One end of the refrigerant tube 77a is connected to the feed pump 75a while one end of the refrigerant tube 77b is connected to the suction pump 75b. The other ends of the refrigerant tubes 77a and 77b built in the cable 81 are connected to the heat receiving part 73 in the probe unit 72. The feed pump 75a feeds the refrigerant to the heat receiving part 73 in the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77a while the suction pump 75b sucks the refrigerant from the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77b.
    The feed pump 75a is provided with a flow regulating valve 76a for regulating the flow rate of the refrigerant fed to the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77a. By changing the drive voltage applied to the feed pump 75a, the flow rate of the refrigerant fed from the feed pump 75a can be regulated. By adjusting the valve travel of the flow regulating valve (aperture size), the flow rate of the refrigerant fed from the feed pump 75a to the refrigerant tube 77a can also be regulated.
    One end of a refrigerant tube 77c is connected to the suction pump 75b while the other end is connected to a header pipe 76a of the radiator 76. The suction pump 75b sucks the refrigerant from the heat receiving part 73 of the ultrasonic probe 2 via the refrigerant tube 77b to feed the refrigerant sucked to the radiator 76 via the refrigerant tube 77c. Furthermore, one end of a refrigerant tube 77d is connected to the feed pump 75a while the other end is connected to a header pipe 76b of the radiator 76. The feed pump 75a sucks the refrigerant from the radiator 76 to feed the refrigerant sucked to the heat receiving part 73 of the ultrasonic probe 2 via the refrigerant tube 77a.
    Now, a structure of the radiator 76 cooling the refrigerant will be described with reference to Figs. 17 to 19. Fig. 18 is a diagram showing a structure of the radiator 76 shown in Fig. 17.
As shown in Figs. 17 and 18, in the radiator 76, a number of hollow refrigerant channels 76c are juxtaposed and connected together. Since such a number of refrigerant channels 76c are juxtaposed and connected together, the radiator 76 has a plate-like shape as a whole. One ends of the refrigerant channels 76c are connected together with a header pipe 76a extending in the juxtaposing direction and the other ends are connected together with a header pipe 76b extending in the juxtaposing direction. By passing the refrigerant through the inside of the refrigerant channels 76c, heat of the refrigerant is radiated outside so as to cool the refrigerant.
    By juxtaposing such a number of the refrigerant channels 76c to be connected together, the surface area (radiation area) of the radiator 76 is increased, so that the rate of the surface area to the size of the radiator 76 is increased. That is, while the surface area (radiation area) is increased, the radiator 76 can be decreased in size, so that even when the radiator 76 is decreased in size, the radiation efficiency can be improved. Since the radiator 76 can be decreased in size, the connector case 82 for housing the radiator 76 can be miniaturized, resulting in the miniaturization of the ultrasonic probe.
    By closely attaching the plate-like radiator 76 on the internal surface of the connector case 82, the heat radiated from surfaces of the plural refrigerant channels 76c of the radiator 76 is liable to be radiated outside. That is, because the heat radiated from the radiator 76 is directly conducted to the connector case 82, the heat is easily radiated outside the connector case 82, cooling the refrigerant efficiently.
    Furthermore, since the plate-like radiator 76 is arranged along the internal surface of the connector case 82, the space occupied by the radiator 76 can be reduced in the connector case 82. Thereby, while the radiation efficiency with the radiator 76 being improved, the ultrasonic probe can be miniaturized.
    Inside the connector case 82, circuit boards 78a, 78b, and 78c are arranged, to which one ends of a plurality of signal lines 81a are connected. The other ends are connected to the probe unit 72, so that an electric signal is transmitted to the probe unit 72 via the signal lines 81a while an electric signal is received from the probe unit 72. A plurality of the signal lines 81a are bundled with the cable 81 and are led into the probe unit 72 from the probe connector part 74.
    The probe connector part 74 is connected to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 with a DL connector 79b. A connector locking structure 80 locks up the probe connector part 74 on the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71. Consequently, the ultrasonic probe is detachably connected to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71.
 9-2. Operation
   Then, the operation of the ultrasonic probe and the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the ninth embodiment will be described. A refrigerant is fed to the refrigerant tube 77a with the feed pump 75a, and the refrigerant is supplied to the heat receiving part 73 in the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77a. The refrigerant arrived at the heat receiving part 73 through the refrigerant tube 77a absorbs the heat within the probe unit 72. Then, by the suction with the suction pump 75b, the refrigerant is sucked to the suction pump 75b from the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77b. The refrigerant sucked to the suction pump 75b is fed to the radiator 76 by the suction pump 75b.
    The refrigerant fed to the radiator 76 is passed within the header pipe 76a in arrow A direction shown in Figs. 17 and 18. Furthermore, the refrigerant is fed to a number of the refrigerant channels 76c from the header pipe 76a of the radiator 76. During passing of the refrigerant through a number of the refrigerant channels 76c, the heat of the refrigerant is radiated outside the refrigerant channels 76c so that the refrigerant is cooled.
    Due to the contact of the plate-like radiator 76 with the inside of the connector case 82, the heat radiated from surfaces of the refrigerant channels 76c is directly conducted to the connector case 82, and the heat conducted is radiated outside the connector case 82.
    Then, the refrigerant is fed outside the radiator 76 (in arrow B direction) from the header pipe 76b through a number of the refrigerant channels 76c, and is passed to the suction pump 75b via the refrigerant tube 77d. In such a manner, by providing a number of the refrigerant channels 76c, the surface area (radiation area) of the radiator 76 is increased, so that the radiation efficiency is improved and the refrigerant can be sufficiently cooled by passing through the radiator 76.
    The refrigerant cooled by the radiator 76 and fed to the feed pump 75a is again delivered to the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 by the feed pump 75a via the refrigerant tube 77a. In such a manner, the heat received in the heat receiving part 73 is radiated with the radiator 76, and the cooled refrigerant is circulated with the pumps 75a and 75b, suppressing the heat accumulation within the probe unit 72.
 9-3. Effect
   As described above, by arranging a number of the refrigerant channels 76c to increase the surface area of the radiator 76, a rate of the surface area (radiation area) of the radiator 76 can be increased compared to the size of it. In other words, even if the radiator 76 is to be smaller in size, the surface area (radiation area) can be increased, thereby improving radiation efficient at a small size. The smaller radiator 76 makes it possible to reduce the connector case 82 housing the radiator 76 in size, thereby reducing the ultrasonic probe in size.
    Furthermore, since a number of the refrigerant channels 76c arranged in parallel forms the radiator 76, the radiator 76 becomes plate-shaped as a whole. This plate-shaped radiator 76 is arranged along to an inside surface of the connector case 82. For example, the radiator 76 is contacted to an inside surface of the connector case 82. Therefore, the heat generated from the radiator 76 is directly conducted to the connector case 82 so that the heat is radiated to outside of the probe connector part 74, thereby improving heat radiation efficient. In addition, the plate-shaped radiator 76 is arranged along to inside surface of the connector case 82. Therefore, the space occupied by the radiator 76 can be reduced in the connector case 82, resulting in the miniaturizing of the ultrasonic probe with improving heat radiation efficient of the radiator 76.
    In addition, the present invention is not limited to the radiator 76 shown in Figs. 17 and 18, so that even when the radiator 76 shown in Fig. 19 is used, for example, the operation and the advantages of the present invention can be obtained. Fig. 19 is a structural drawing showing a modified example of the radiator 76 shown in Fig. 18.
In the radiator 76 shown in Fig. 18, the width of the individual refrigerant passage 76c is narrow and a number of the refrigerant channels 76c are connected together. In the radiator 76 shown in Fig. 19, three refrigerant channels 76c are connected together in parallel with each other, so that the width of the individual refrigerant passage 76c becomes wide. In such a manner, even when the number of the refrigerant channels 76c is reduced so as to increase the width of the individual refrigerant passage 76c, the operation and the advantages of the present invention can also be obtained.
    In the radiator 76 according to the ninth embodiment, a plurality of the refrigerant channels 76c are connected together in parallel with each other; however, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, by folding one refrigerant passage at a plurality of times, the whole structure may be plate-shaped. According to the embodiment, one radiator 76 is provided; alternatively, on any internal surfaces of the connector case 82, the radiators 76 may be provided.
 10. Tenth Embodiment
   A summary structure of a probe connector part according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 20 and 21. Fig. 20 is a front view of a probe connector part of an ultrasonic probe according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 21 is a sectional view of the probe connector part along the line segment B-B' shown in Fig. 20.
    A probe connector part according to the tenth embodiment is substantially the same in configuration as the probe connector part according to the ninth embodiment; however, the point differs in that electric components built in the connector case 82, such as the circuit board 78a, are spaced from the cooling unit including the radiator 76 with a heat insulating partition member 83 therebetween.
    Specifically, electrical components, such as the signal lines 81a and the circuit board 78a, are spaced from the radiator 76, the pumps 75a and 75b, and the refrigerant tube 77a with the heat insulating partition member 83 therebetween. The partition member 83 is arranged within the connector case 82 so as to surround the electrical components including the signal lines 81a and the circuit board 78a, and the radiator 76, the pumps 75a and 75b, and the refrigerant tube 77a are arranged outside the partition member 83. That is, the electric system is divided from the cooling system. The partition member 83 is made of a low heat-conductive material including a non-metallic material. For example, the partition member 83 is made of a resin such as a plastic.
    In the ultrasonic probe with large heat-generation to an extent needing a cooling unit, it is assumed that there is a heat source, such as the circuit board 78a, also inside the probe connector part 74. Therefore, the heat generated by the electric system, such as the circuit board 78a, may reduce the radiation efficiency of the radiator 76.
    In an ultrasonic probe connector 4 according to the tenth embodiment, the cooling unit including the radiator 76 and the pumps 75a and 75b is spaced from the heat source, such as the circuit board 78a, with the heat insulating partition member 83 therebetween, so that the heat generated from the heat source including the circuit board 78a is difficult to be conducted to the cooling unit including the radiator 76 and the pumps 75a and 75b, thereby preventing the reduction in radiation efficiency of the radiator 76.
    In the cooling unit including the radiator 76, the pumps 75a and 75b, and the refrigerant tube 77a, the refrigerant circulates. The leakage of the circulating refrigerant through the radiator 76 or the refrigerant tube 77a may cause short-circuit of the electric components such as the circuit board 78a and the signal lines 81a. In the probe connector part 74 according to the tenth embodiment, the electric system, such as the circuit board 78a, is housed within the partition member 83 and spaced from the cooling unit including the radiator 76 and the pumps 75a and 75b, so that even the refrigerant leaks from the cooling system including the radiator 76, the refrigerant cannot be in contact with the electric system, such as the circuit board 78a. Therefore, electric components cannot be shortcircuited.
 11. Eleventh Embodiment
11-1. Constitution
   A summary structure of a probe connector part according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 22 and 23. Fig. 22 is a perspective view of a connector case included in a probe connector part of an ultrasonic probe according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 23 is a front view of the probe connector part shown in Fig. 22.
    A probe connector part according to the eleventh embodiment is substantially the same in configuration as the probe connector part according to the ninth embodiment; however, the shape of the connector case differs therefrom. Fig. 22 shows only a connector case 84 of the probe connector part 74. In practice, from the connector case 84, the cable 81 having the signal lines 81a and the refrigerant tubes 77a and 77b built therein extends to the probe unit 72.
    As shown in Figs. 22 and 23, both lateral faces of the connector case 84 are roughened so as to have uneven surfaces. This increases the radiation area larger than that when the both lateral faces are flat, so that the lateral faces function as cooling fins. It is preferable for the material of the connector case 84 to be heat-conductive and heat-radiative highly like aluminum (Al); however, the present invention is not limited to these materials so that metals such as copper (Cu) and alloys such as SUS may also be used.
    The bonding method between the radiator 76 and the connector case 84 preferably includes firm one such as welding and brazing in view of thermal conduction; alternatively, it may include screwing using heat-conductive silicone grease therebetween so as to secure sufficient heat conductivity.
    Since the radiator 76 is installed on the internal surface of the connector case 84 in contact therewith in the same way as- in the embodiments described above, the heat of the refrigerant passing through the radiator 76 is transmitted to the internal surface (lateral surfaces) of the connector case 84 and radiated outside therefrom. Because of the uneven lateral surfaces, the radiation area is increased larger than that of the flat lateral surfaces so as to radiate more heat quantity. As the heat-radiation is improved in such a manner, the heat of the refrigerant passing through the radiator 76 can be efficiently radiated outside the connector case 84, resulting in improvement in cooling capacity of the cooling system.
    Furthermore, according to the eleventh embodiment, as shown in Fig. 23, the radiators 76 are installed on both lateral faces of the connector case 84. This allows the heat of the refrigerant passing through the radiators 76 to be radiated outside from both surfaces of the connector case 84, so that the heat radiation is further improved, resulting in further improvement in cooling capacity of the cooling system.
 11-2. Operation
   Then, the operation of the ultrasonic probe and the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the eleventh embodiment will be simply described. A refrigerant is fed to the refrigerant tube 77a with the feed pump 75a, and the refrigerant is supplied to the heat receiving part 73 in the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77a. The refrigerant arrived at the heat receiving part 73 through the refrigerant tube 77a absorbs the heat within the ultrasonic probe. Then, by the suction with the suction pump 75b, the refrigerant is sucked to the suction pump 75b from the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77b. The refrigerant sucked to the suction pump 75b is fed to the two radiators 76 arranged in the both side of the connector case 84 via the refrigerant tube 77c.
    The refrigerant fed to the radiators 76 is passed to a number of the refrigerant channels 76c via the header pipes 76a. During passing of the refrigerant through a number of the refrigerant channels 76c, the heat of the refrigerant is radiated outside the radiators 76 so that the refrigerant is cooled. Since lateral faces of the connector case 84 have an uneven shape so as to form cooling fins, the radiation area is increased so as to efficiently dissipate the heat of the refrigerant outside the connector case 84. Then, the refrigerant is fed outside the radiators 76 from the header pipe 76b through a number of the refrigerant channels 76c, and is passed to the feed pump 75a from the two radiators 76 via the refrigerant tube 77d.
    In such a manner, by connecting a number of the refrigerant channels 76c together in parallel with each other as well as by roughening lateral faces of the connector case 84 so as to form fins, the radiation areas of the radiators 76 and the connector case 84 are increased, so that the radiation efficiency is further improved. Since the size of the radiator 76 need not be increased for improving the radiation efficiency, the ultrasonic probe can be miniaturized.
    Furthermore, the near surface in which the radiator 76 was installed, among surfaces of the outer side of the connector case 84, is made uneven. Therefore, the heat radiated heat from the radiator 76 snd transmitted to the connector case 84 is easy to be radiated outside from the connector case 84, thereby improving the efficiency of radiation.
    The refrigerant cooled by the two radiators 76 and fed to the feed pump 75a is again delivered to the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 by the feed pump 75a via the refrigerant tube 77a.
    In addition, according to the eleventh embodiment, the radiators 76 are installed on both lateral faces of the connector case 84; alternatively, the radiator 76 may be arranged only on one side like in the probe connector parts according to the ninth and tenth embodiments. When the radiator 76 is arranged only on one side, the external lateral face adjacent to the radiator 76 is roughened. In such a manner, by roughening the external lateral face of the connector case 84 in accordance with the installation site of the radiator 76, the heat radiated from the radiator 76 and transmitted to the connector case 84 is liable to be radiated outside, improving the radiation efficiency.
    In the probe connector part according to the ninth and tenth embodiments, by installing the radiators 76 on both lateral faces of the connector case, the cooling capacity of the cooling system may also be increased by improving the radiation of the radiator 76.
 12. Twelfth Embodiment
   A summary structure of a probe connector part according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 24 and 25. Fig. 24 is a front view of a probe connector part of an ultrasonic probe according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 25 is a sectional view of the probe connector part along the line segment B-B' shown in Fig. 24.
    A probe connector part according to the twelfth embodiment also includes the pumps 75a and 75b and the radiator 76 arranged on one side of the connector case 85 in the same way as in the probe connector part according to the ninth embodiment; furthermore, it includes a cooling fan 86 within the connector case 85. The cooling fan 86 is arranged in the connector case 85 on its front surface side, for example, so as to take ambient air into the connector case 85 from the outside of the connector case 85.
    In the same way as in the probe connector part according to the tenth embodiment, the electric components, such as the circuit board 78a, are housed within the partition member 83 and spaced from the cooling system including the radiator 76 and the pumps 75a and 75b.
    Furthermore, a heat insulating material 87 is provided between the radiator 76 and the partition member 83. Between the radiator 76 and the heat insulating material 87, a minute gap is formed to extend in the juxtaposing direction of the refrigerant channels 76c. The minute gap forms an air channel 88, and the ambient air taken in by the cooling fan 86 from the front surface of the connector case 85 flows through the air channel 88 so as to pass through toward the rear surface (surface remote from the cooling fan 86) of the connector case 85 (arrow C direction).
    The ambient air may also be taken in from the rear surface of the connector case 85 so as to pass through toward the front surface of the connector case 85 (opposite to arrow C direction). More specifically, the cooling fan 86 may not be used for suction, but for discharge. When the cooling fan 86 is used for discharge so as to form a flow of the ambient air in the opposite to arrow C direction, it is expectable to form the flow of the flatter ambient air.
    The air channel 88 is provided with a radiation plate 88a made of a metal, such as copper, and connected to the radiator 76 and the heat insulating material 87. The radiation plate 88a is arranged between the radiator 76 and the heat insulating material 87 in a state folded at a plurality of times.
    Also, in the connector case 85, the external surface adjacent to the radiator 76 is roughened so as to function as cooling fins. According to the twelfth embodiment, the radiator 76 is provided only on one side; alternatively, the radiators 76 may be provided on both sides like in the ultrasonic probe connector according to the eleventh embodiment. Moreover, external both side surfaces of the connector case 85 may be roughened.
    According to the probe connector part 74 constructed as described above, with the cooling fan 86 provided inside the connector case 85, ambient air is taken into from the outside of the connector case 85. The taken ambient air flows through the air channel 88 formed between the radiator 76 and the heat insulating material 87 so as to be discharged outside the connector case 85 from an outlet (not shown) formed on the rear side of the connector case 85, for example (the ambient air flows through in arrow C direction). The radiator 76 is brought into contact with the ambient air in such a manner, so that not only from the lateral surface of the connector case 85, but also with the ambient air, the heat from the radiator 76 is discharged to the outside, thereby efficiently reducing the temperature of the refrigerant passing through the radiator 76.
    When the heat value is increased in the probe unit 72 so that the more improved heat radiation efficiency is demanded, it is necessary to improve the cooling efficiency by the refrigerant in the radiator 76. According to the twelfth embodiment, the cooling fan 86 is provided within the connector case 85 so as to forcedly cool the radiator 76, so that the temperature of the refrigerant flowing through the radiator 76 can be further reduced efficiently.
 13. Thirteenth Embodiment
   A probe connector part and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core according to the thirteenth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 26 and 27. Fig. 26 is a side view of a probe connector part of an ultrasonic probe and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core according to the thirteenth embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 27 is a top view of the probe connector part and the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core shown in Fig. 26.
    A probe connector part according to the thirteenth embodiment includes the pump 75 in the same way as in the probe connector part according to the ninth embodiment, and it also includes the radiator 76 on one side of a connector case 90. According to the thirteenth embodiment, with the one pump 75 provided, the refrigerant is fed and sucked. By folding a refrigerant tube made of a metal, such as copper, the radiator 76 has a plate-like shape as a whole. Furthermore, a refrigerant tank 89 is provided within the connector case 85 for temporarily storing the refrigerant.
    Furthermore, in the same way as in the probe connector part according to the twelfth embodiment, within the connector case 90, a heat insulating material (not shown) is provided along the radiator 76, and the air channel 88 is formed between the heat insulating material and the radiator 76. Different from the twelfth embodiment, the cooling fan 86 is not arranged within the connector case 90 but within an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71. Inside the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71, an air channel 91 is provided for passing ambient air into the connector case 90. The cooling fan 86 is arranged inside the air channel 91 so as to take ambient air into the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 from the outside of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 (arrow D direction). The taken ambient air is fed into the probe connector part 74.
    Note that, the cooling fan 86 may not be used for suction, but for discharge like the twelfth embodiment. When a flow of the ambient air is formed in the opposite to arrow D direction, it is expectable to form the flow of the flatter ambient air.
    In the connector case 90 of the probe connector part 74, an opening 92a is formed adjacent to the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 for introducing the ambient air fed from the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 into the connector case 90. From the opening 92a, the ambient air is taken into the connector case 90 so as to be exhausted to outside thereof from an outlet 92b formed on the front bottom of the connector case 90 via the air channel 88.
    The radiator 76 is brought into contact with ambient air, so that not only from the lateral surface of the connector case 90, but also with the ambient air, the heat from the radiator 76 is discharged to the outside, thereby efficiently reducing the temperature of the refrigerant passing through the radiator 76. Moreover, by providing the cooling fan 86 in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71, the probe connector part 74 can be miniaturize by the size of the cooling fan 86.
    Then, the operation of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the thirteenth embodiment will be simply described. With the pump 75, a refrigerant is sucked from the refrigerant tank 89 so as to feed it to the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 via the refrigerant tube 77a. Then, in the same way as in the embodiments described above, the heat generated in the probe unit 72 is absorbed in refrigerant in the heat receiving part 73. The refrigerant returns to the probe connector part 74 by being sucked to the pump 75 via the refrigerant tube 77b. Then, the refrigerant with a temperature increased by absorbing the heat of the probe unit 72 is supplied to the radiator 76 with the pump 75. Since the radiator 76 is closely attached on the internal surface of the connector case 90, the heat of the refrigerant is radiated outside the connector case 90 via the lateral surface of the connector case 90 with the radiator 76. Furthermore, with the ambient air fed by the cooling fan 86, the temperature of the radiator 76 is reduced, thereby decreasing the temperature of the refrigerant. The refrigerant with a temperature decreased by the radiator 76 is fed to the refrigerant tank 89 from the radiator 76 by the pump 75 so as to be stored therein. Then, with the pump 75, the refrigerant is again fed to the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 from the refrigerant tank 89. By repeating this series of processes, the temperature increase of the probe unit 72 is suppressed.
 14. Fourteenth Embodiment
14-1. Constitution
   An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 28. Fig. 28 is a diagram showing a summary structure of an ultrasonic probe and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core according to the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention.
    In an ultrasonic probe according to the fourteenth embodiment, at least one of the temperature of the probe unit 72 and the temperature of a refrigerant is detected, and the probe unit 72 is maintained in a safety temperature range by controlling the operation of the pump 75 or the cooling fan 86 of the cooling unit on the basis of the detected result.
    If the cooling unit including the pump 75 and the radiator 76 is always operated with its full power, the temperature rise of the probe unit 72 can be suppressed to a minimum. However, if the cooling capacity of the cooling unit is designed to be large in accordance with the assumed high heat value of the probe unit 72, under the operating conditions of the probe unit 72, such as the condition that the probe unit 72 is scarcely heated, or the small rise in temperature of the probe unit 72 due to a low ambient temperature, when the probe unit 72 is cooled with the designed cooling power, the temperature in the ultrasonic probe is reduced to excess, so that dew condensation may be generated in the probe unit 72. Since the cooling unit includes electric components such as the pump 75 and the cooling fan 86, electric power is consumed by the operation of the cooling unit. At the temperature not necessary for the cooling, if the cooling unit is always operated with its full power, electric power is consumed in vain.
    Then, in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the fourteenth embodiment, the temperature of the probe unit 72 or the temperature of the refrigerant is detected, and the generation of dew condensation and useless electric power consumption due to the excess cooling are suppressed by controlling the operation of the cooling unit on the basis of the detected result.
    The structures of the probe unit 72 and the probe connector part 74 provided in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus according to the fourteenth embodiment are substantially the same as those according to the ninth to thirteenth embodiments. In Fig. 28, the probe connector part according to the thirteenth embodiment is shown as a representative; alternatively, it may be one of the probe connector parts according to the ninth to twelfth embodiments.
    According to the fourteenth embodiment, a temperature detection unit (temperature sensor) 93 is provided within the probe unit 72 or the probe connector part 74. When the temperature detection unit 93 is arranged within the probe unit 72, the temperature detection unit 93 is arranged at least at any one of the position adjacent to the piezoelectric transducers as the heating source (close to the surface of the probe unit 72), the position in the vicinity of the heat receiving part 73, and the position in the vicinity of the circuit board (not shown). Hence, for monitoring temperatures of a plurality of positions, the temperature detection units 93 may be arranged at a plurality of positions, or for monitoring the temperature of one position, the temperature detection unit 93 may be arranged only at one position. By arranging the temperature detection unit 93 within the probe unit 72 in such a manner, the temperature of the probe unit 72 is monitored.
    When the temperature detection unit 93 is arranged within the probe connector part 74, the temperature detection unit 93 is arranged at least at the position in the vicinity of the radiator 76 or the position in the vicinity of the refrigerant tank 89. In this case, the temperature detection units 93 may also be arranged at a plurality of positions, or the temperature detection unit 93 may be arranged only at one position. By arranging the temperature detection unit 93 at the position in the vicinity of the radiator 76 or the refrigerant tank 89 in such a manner, the temperature of the refrigerant is monitored. Alternatively, the temperature detection units 93 may be arranged in both the probe unit 72 and the probe connector part 74 so that both the temperatures are monitored.
    When monitoring the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 directly, the temperature detection unit 93 may be arranged at a position in the probe unit 72 close to its surface (the position adjacent to the piezoelectric transducers). Even if the temperature detection unit 93 is not arranged at a position in the probe unit 72 close to its surface in such a manner, when the peripheral temperature is detected by arranging the temperature detection unit 93 in the vicinity of the circuit board (not shown) in the probe unit 72 or in the vicinity of the heat receiving part 73, the surface temperature can also be monitored indirectly. Also, the temperature in the probe unit 72 can also be indirectly monitored by assuming the heat value absorbed in the heat receiving part 73 by arranging the temperature detection unit 93 in the vicinity of the radiator 76 within the connector case so as to monitor the temperature of the refrigerant.
    A signal line 94 is connected to the temperature detection unit 93 so that an electric signal indicating a temperature detected by the temperature detection unit 93 is outputted to an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 via the signal line 94.
    The ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 has a temperature detection unit 71a, a system control unit 71b, a refrigerant flux control unit 71c and a cooling fan control unit 71d for controlling a cooling system.
The temperature detection unit 71a calculates the temperature on the basis of the electric signal from the temperature detection unit 93. The system control unit 71b obtains the drive condition of the cooling unit, in which the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 is included in a safety temperature range, from the drive state of the probe unit 72 and the temperature calculated by the temperature detection unit 71a so as to output a control signal to the refrigerant flux control unit 71c or the cooling fan control unit 71d. The safety temperature range herein means a temperature range being safe even when the probe unit 72 is brought into contact with the object. In general, the safety temperature range is from 30°C to 50°C, so that the drive condition of the cooling unit, in which the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 is included in this temperature range, is obtained.
    For example, a coordinate table between the temperature detected by the temperature detection unit 93 and the drive condition of the cooling unit for maintaining the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 within the safety temperature range is prepared in advance so as to store the table in a memory (not shown) provided in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71.
    Specifically, a coordinate table between the temperature detected by the temperature detection unit 93 and the flow rate of the refrigerant, a coordinate table between the detected temperature and the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75, and a coordinate table between the detected temperature and the drive voltage to be applied to the cooling fan 86 are prepared and stored in the memory in advance. Then, the system control unit 71b refers to the tables stored in the memory on the basis of the detected temperature so as to obtain the flow rate of the refrigerant for maintaining the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 within the safety temperature range and the drive voltage of the pump 75 or the cooling fan 86. The control signals indicating the obtained drive voltage and so forth are outputted to the refrigerant flux control unit 71c or the cooling fan control unit 71d.
    The refrigerant flux control unit 71c is connected to the pump 75 so as to change the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 and the valve travel of the flow regulating valve 76a for adjusting the flow rate on the basis of the control signal outputted from the system control unit 71b. The cooling fan control unit 71d is connected to the cooling fan 86 so as to change the voltage or the frequency of driving signal to be applied to the cooling fan 86 on the basis of the control signal outputted from the system control unit 71b.
 14-2. Operation
   The operation of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus constructed as described above will be described. First, with the temperature detection unit 93 arranged within the probe unit 72 or the probe connector part 74, the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 and the peripheral temperature of the radiator 76 are detected. The case where the temperature detection unit 93 is arranged in the probe unit 72 close to its surface (adjacent to ultrasonic transducers) will be described herein.
    The electric signal corresponding to the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 detected by the temperature detection unit 93 is outputted to the temperature detection unit 71a provided in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 through signal lines 94. The temperature detection unit 71a calculates the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 using the received electric signal so as to output the temperature information to the system control unit 71b. The system control unit 71b obtains the drive condition of the cooling system for maintaining the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 within the safety temperature range on the basis of the temperature information.
    If the detected temperature is high, the cooling power of the cooling system is increased while if the detected temperature is low, the cooling power of the cooling system is reduced. That is, with increasing temperature detected, the cooling power of the cooling system is increased. For example, the cooling power is controlled by changing the drive condition of the pump 75 so as to adjust the flow rate of the refrigerant. If the detected temperature is high, the volume of the refrigerant fed to the heat receiving part 73 from the pump 75 is increased while if the detected temperature is low, the volume of the refrigerant fed to the heat receiving part 73 from the pump 75 is decreased.
    In order to perform such control, the system control unit 71b refers to the tables stored in the memory (not shown) in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 so as to obtain the flow rate of the refrigerant from the tables and the detected temperature. In this case, a coordinate table between the detected temperature and the flow rate of the refrigerant for maintaining the temperature within the safety temperature range is prepared in advance and the flow rate of the refrigerant is obtained by referring to this table. Then, the drive voltage for passing the refrigerant at this flow rate is obtained so as to output this voltage information to the refrigerant flux control unit 71c.
    Also, a coordinate table between the detected temperature and the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 for maintaining the temperature within the safety temperature range may be prepared in advance and the drive voltage may be obtained by referring to this table so as to output this voltage information to the refrigerant flux control unit 71c.
    If the detected temperature is high, the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 is increased so as to increase the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied from the pump 75. On the other hand, if the detected temperature is low, the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 7-5 is reduced so as to decrease the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied from the pump 75. That is, with increasing temperature detected, the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 is increased so as to increase the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied from the pump 75.
    The refrigerant flux control unit 71c drives the pump 75 at the drive voltage obtained from the system control unit 71b. With increasing temperature detected, the higher drive voltage is applied to the pump 75 so as to increase the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied from the pump 75. By changing the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 corresponding to the detected temperature in such a manner, the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 can be maintained within the safety temperature range. Moreover, since the probe unit 72 is not cooled to excess, the electric power cannot be consumed in vain. The generation of dew condensation due to excessive cooling can also be suppressed.
    Not only by changing the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75, but also by adjusting the aperture size (valve travel) of the flow regulating valve 76a provided in the pump 75 for regulating the flow rate of the refrigerant, the flow rate of the refrigerant fed to the heat receiving part 73 of the probe unit 72 from the pump 75 may also be regulated.
    In order to perform such control, the system control unit 71b refers to the tables stored in the memory (not shown) in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 so as to obtain the flow rate of the refrigerant from the tables and the detected temperature. In this case, a coordinate table between the detected temperature and the flow rate of the refrigerant for maintaining the temperature within the safety temperature range is prepared in advance and the flow rate of the refrigerant is obtained by referring to this table. Then, the aperture size (valve travel) of the flow regulating valve 76a for passing the refrigerant at this flow rate is obtained so as to output this opening information to the refrigerant flux control unit 71c. Then, the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a is adjusted by the control of the refrigerant flux control unit 71c so as to regulate the flow rate of the refrigerant to be fed to the heat receiving part 73.
    If the detected temperature is high, the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a is increased by the control of the refrigerant flux control unit 71c so as to increase the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied to the heat receiving part 73. On the other hand, if the detected temperature is low, the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a is reduced by the control of the refrigerant flux control unit 71c so as to decrease the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied to the heat receiving part 73. That is, with increasing temperature detected, the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a is increased so as to increase the flow rate of the refrigerant supplied from the pump 75. By changing the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a provided in the pump 75 corresponding to the detected temperature in such a manner, the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 can be maintained within the safety temperature range. Moreover, the generation of dew condensation due to excessive cooling can be suppressed.
    When controlling the cooling power by adjusting the flow rate of the air flowing through the probe connector part 74, the system control unit 71b obtains the drive condition of the cooling fan 86. If the detected temperature is high, the rotational speed of the cooling fan 86 is increased so as to increase the flow rate of the ambient air taken into the probe connector part 74. The system control unit 71b obtains the drive voltage of the cooling fan 86 for increasing the flow rate of the ambient air to be taken so as to output the voltage information to the cooling fan control unit 71d. In this case, with increasing temperature detected, the drive voltage applied to the cooling fan 86 is also increased so as to increase the flow rate of the ambient air taken by the cooling fan 86.
    In order to perform such control, the system control unit 71b refers to the tables stored in the memory (not shown) in the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus core 71 so as to obtain the drive voltage of the cooling fan from the tables and the detected temperature. In this case, a coordinate table between the detected temperature and the drive voltage of the cooling fan for maintaining the temperature within the safety temperature range is prepared in advance, and the drive voltage of the cooling fan is obtained by referring to this table. Then, the voltage information is outputted to the cooling fan control unit 71d, and the rotational speed of the cooling fan 86 is adjusted by the control of the cooling fan control unit 71d so as to adjust the flow rate of the ambient air.
    The cooling fan control unit 71d drives the cooling fan 86 at the drive voltage obtained from the system control unit 71b. With increasing temperature detected, the higher drive voltage is applied to the cooling fan 86 so as to increase the flow rate of the ambient air taken by the cooling fan 86. By changing the drive voltage to be applied to the cooling fan 86 corresponding to the detected temperature in such a manner, the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 can be maintained within the safety temperature range. Moreover, since the probe unit 72 is not cooled to excess, the electric power cannot be consumed in vain. The generation of dew condensation due to excessive cooling can also be suppressed.
    With the changed frequency, the cooling fan 86 may be driven. With increasing temperature detected, the cooling fan control unit 71d drives the cooling fan 86 at a higher frequency so as to increase the rotational speed of the cooling fan 86 for increasing the flow rate of the ambient air to be taken. By controlling the frequency in such a manner, the operation and advantages of the present invention may also be obtained.
    As described above, by changing the drive condition of the pump 75 or the cooling fan 86 on the basis of the detected temperature, the cooling can be performed in accordance with the temperature of the probe unit 72. As a result, the temperature of the probe unit 72 can be maintained within the safety temperature range, thereby suppressing the generation of dew condensation and the useless electric power consumption due to the excessive cooling.
    In the examples described above, the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 is directly detected by arranging the temperature detection unit 93 in the probe unit 72 close to its surface; alternatively, by arranging the temperature detection unit 93 in the vicinity of the radiator 76 within the probe connector part 74, the temperature of the radiator 76 may be detected so as to indirectly monitor the temperature of the probe unit 72 for controlling it.
    If the peripheral temperature of the radiator 76 is high, the heat value radiated from the radiator 76 is determined large. That is, in the heat receiving part 73, the heat absorbed by the refrigerant is determined large. In this case, the temperature of the probe unit 72 is determined high, so that when the detected temperature is high, the system control unit 71b and so forth increase the cooling power of the cooling system. As described above, by increasing the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 or by increasing the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a provided in the pump 75, the flow rate of the refrigerant to be fed to the probe unit 72 is increased. By increasing the drive voltage to be applied to the cooling fan 86, the flow rate of the ambient air taken from the outside is also increased.
    On the other hand, if the peripheral temperature of the radiator 76 is low, the heat value radiated from the radiator 76 is determined small. That is, in the heat receiving part 73, the heat absorbed by the refrigerant is determined small. In this case, the temperature of the probe unit 72 is determined low, so that when the detected temperature is low, the system control unit 71b and so forth reduce the cooling power of the cooling system. As described above, by reducing the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75 or by reducing the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a provided in the pump 75, the flow rate of the refrigerant to be fed to the probe unit 72 is decreased. By reducing the drive voltage to be applied to the cooling fan 86, the flow rate of the ambient air taken from the outside is also decreased.
    In such a manner, by changing the drive voltage to be applied to the pump 75, the aperture size of the flow regulating valve 76a provided in the pump 75, or the drive voltage to be applied to the cooling fan 86 in accordance with the detected temperature (peripheral I temperature of the radiator 76), the surface temperature of the probe unit 72 can be maintained within the safety temperature range. Also, since the probe unit 72 is not cooled to excess, the electric power cannot be consumed in vain. Furthermore, the generation of dew condensation due to excessive cooling can be suppressed.
    In conclusion, the ultrasonic probe and the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus constructed as mentioned above can adjust a cooling capacity so as to keep a necessary transmission sound energy flux with a safe surface temperature.
    Various functions of the ultrasonic probe according to the first to the fourteenth embodiments described above may be combined so as to form an ultrasonic probe.

BACKGROUND
1. Field of the Invention
This invention generally relates to a therapeutic ultrasound method and system, and more particularly, to a method and system for ultrasound treatment for superficial tissue containing sweat glands.
2. Description of the Related Art
The sweat glands in the body are of divided into apocrine and eccrine glands. Apocrine glands are similar to sebaceous glands, and are present mainly in the axillae. These glands, like sebaceous glands, secrete an oily proteinaceous product into the follicles. Bacterial digestion of apocrine sweat is largely responsible for underarm “body odor”. Similarly, eccrine sweat glands are present deep in the dermis in the palms, soles and armpits and are responsible for temperature regulation resulting from sweating. Excessive activity of these glands also results in copious amounts of abnormal sweating (“hyperhidrosis”), primarily under autonomic neuronal control. Reduction of sweating from under the armpits and other regions is a particularly desirable effect within the modern society. Presently, chemical antiperspirants and deodorants are used frequently as a matter of personal hygiene. Antiperspirants are aluminum based salts that block the sweat gland ducts. The deodorant changes the pH of the skin milieu thereby minimizing the presence of (smell inducing) bacteria. The effects with both these components however, are temporary and these chemicals are known to irritate the skin in a good percentage of users.
Further, there is currently a significant unmet need in managing the excessive sweating and concomitant issues with odor as a result of Hydradenitis suppurativa (irritable infected armpit). This acne-like process in apocine follicles also causes hydradenitis suppurativa, which is often a devastating condition in which very painful cysts and scarring occurs repeatedly in the axillae. The etiology (causes) of this clinical condition is not well understood. However, there are a number of marginally effective approaches to manage this condition. Retinoid drug therapy works marginally but is associated with severe toxicity. Some prescription formulations of antiperspirants can be used, but they are not particularly effective. These preparations can be applied with the addition of an iontophoretic device. This technique however, is not known to be any more effective than the formulation. The sweat glands can be surgically removed from the armpits and/or the sympathetic nerve supply can be interrupted surgically. This approach is fraught with its own drawbacks in terms of morbidity, scarring and cost. BOTOX® is being used ever more for paralyzing the nerve connections that induce excessive sweating in the armpits. However, this is a new approach yet to be completely validated. This technique requires multiple injections (painful) and the results last a few months only (3-4 months), hence need to be repeated. This technique does not get rid of the odor associated with the condition.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention describes a non-invasive method and system for using therapeutic ultrasound energy for the treatment of conditions resulting from sweat gland disorders. An ultrasound system and method comprises a transducer probe and control system configured to deliver ultrasound energy to the regions of the superficial tissue (e.g., skin) such that the energy can be deposited at the particular depth at which the aberrant sweat gland population is located below the skin surface.
In accordance with various exemplary embodiments, the ultrasound transducer can be driven at a number of different frequency regimes such that the depth and shape of energy concentration can match the region of treatment. In addition, the ultrasound source or beam radiated from the transducer can be highly focused, weakly focused, or divergent, each in a cylindrical or spherical geometric configuration, and/or can also be planar to radiate a directive beam through the tissue, or various other configurations. Further, the ultrasound field can be varied spatially and temporally in a suitable manner to achieve the optimal tissue effect and/or type of conformal lesion for treating the sweat glands.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The present invention may be described herein in terms of various components and processing steps. It should be appreciated that such components and steps may be realized by any number of hardware components configured to perform the specified functions. For example, the present invention may be configured with various medical treatment devices, visual imaging and display devices, input terminals and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more control systems or other control devices. In addition, the present invention may be practiced in any number of medical or treatment contexts and that the exemplary embodiments relating to a method and system for sweat gland treatment as described herein are merely a few of the exemplary applications for the invention. For example, the principles, features and methods discussed may be applied to any medical or other tissue or treatment application.
In accordance with various aspects of the present invention, a non-invasive method and system for the treatment of sweat glands is described. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, an ultrasound transducer probe and control system are configured to deliver ultrasound energy to a targeted/specified depth and zone where the sweat gland population is required to be treated. The ultrasound beam from the transducer probe can be spatially and/or temporally adjusted, modified or otherwise controlled to match the adequate treatment of the sweat glands in the region of interest.
For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, with reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary treatment system 100 configured to treat a region of interest (ROI) 106 comprises a control system 102, an imaging/therapy probe with acoustic coupling 104, and a display system 108.
Control system 102 and display 108 can comprise various configurations for controlling functionality of probe 104 and system 100, including for example a microprocessor with software and a plurality of input/output and communication devices, a system for controlling electronic and/or mechanical scanning and/or multiplexing of transducers, a system for power delivery, systems for monitoring, systems for sensing the spatial parameters and/or temporal parameters of the probe and transducers, and/or systems for handling user input and recording treatment input and results, among others. Imaging/therapy probe 104 can comprise various probe and/or transducer configurations. For example, probe 104 can be configured for a combined dual-mode imaging/therapy transducer, coupled or co-housed imaging/therapy transducers, a separate therapy probe and separate imaging probe, or a single therapy probe. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, imaging transducers may operate at frequencies from approximately 2 MHz to 75 MHz or more, while therapy energy can be delivered at frequencies from approximately 500 kHz to 15 MHz, with 2 MHz to 25 MHz being typical.
With reference to FIG. 2A, sweat glands 230 are generally located within a dermis layer 214 at a depth close to hair bulbs 236. In order to treat sweat glands that require treatment in particular anatomical sites, such as, for example but not limited to, the axillary region (armpit), the palms and soles, an ultrasound transducer probe can be coupled to the skin tissue using one of the numerous coupling media, such as water, mineral oils, gels, and the like.
For example, with reference to FIG. 2B, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment an exemplary treatment method and system are configured for initially imaging a region 222 within a region of interest 206 and displaying that region 224 on a display 208 to facilitate localization of the treatment area and surrounding structures, e.g., identification of sweat glands 230, such as within the axillary region (armpit), the palms and soles or any other tissue or skin surrounding sweat glands. After localization, delivery of ultrasound energy 220 at a depth, distribution, timing, and energy level to achieve the desired therapeutic effect of thermal ablation to treat a sweat gland 230 is provided. Before, during, and/or after therapy, i.e., before, during and/or after delivery of ultrasound energy, monitoring of the treatment area and surrounding structures can be conducted to further planning and assessing of the results and/or providing feedback to control system 202 and a system operator.
In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, localization can be facilitated through ultrasound imaging that can be used to define the position of a sweat gland 230 and/or the depth of sweat glands 230 over a region of interest before depositing in a defined pattern at a target region 220. Such glands can be seen lying along hair follicles 232 and bulbs 236 and their image may be further enhanced via signal and image processing. Ultrasound imaging can also be used for safety purposes, namely, to avoid injuring vital structures, such as nerve endings 240. In accordance with other exemplary embodiments, localization can also be accomplished without imaging region 222, but instead can be based on prior known depths of sweat glands or other target regions, and thus be configured geometrically and/or electronically to selectively deposit energy at a particular known depth below skin surface 210 to a target region 220.
The ultrasound beam from probe 204 can be spatially and/or temporally controlled by changing the spatial parameters of the transducer, such as the placement, distance, treatment depth and transducer structure, as well as by changing the temporal parameters of transducer, such as the frequency, drive amplitude, and timing, with such control handled via control system 202. For example, in some applications, the temporal energy exposure at one location may range from approximately to 40 ms to 40 seconds, while the corresponding source frequency can suitably range from approximately 500 kHz to 15 MHz. Such spatial and temporal parameters can also be suitably monitored and/or utilized in open-loop and/or closed-loop feedback systems within treatment system 200. As a result of such spatial and/or temporal control, conformal lesions of various, specifically targeted, shapes, sizes and orientations can be configured within target region 220.
In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the treatment resulting from ultrasound energy delivery in the region of sweat glands 230 can be used to achieve selective ablation of regions of sub-epidermal region (0.5-10 mm diameter zones). For example, one or more treated zones 242 can be configured to produce regions of ablative damage in spatially defined patterns, such as a discrete locus of spaced treatment spots or two- or three-dimensional matrix of damage or destroyed tissue, e.g., a matrix of cross-stitched, ellipsoidal/cigar-shaped, wedge-shaped, mushroom-shaped or any other conformal lesions, rather than heating and destroying the entire volume of the target layer of tissue. In such a treatment where surrounding regions are spared of damage, the surrounding undamaged tissue aids rapid healing and recovery.
In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a whole contiguous sheet of treatment area can be achieved, whereby all the sweat glands within the said area are ablated. In addition to selective treatment of sweat gland regions, in accordance with another exemplary embodiment, treatment system 200 could be configured to “carpet bomb” the fat layer at 1-7 mm depth, e.g., up to 90% of the sweat glands in the armpit can be ablated without any physiologic issues.
In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an exemplary monitoring method may comprise monitoring the temperature profile or other tissue parameters of the region of interest 206, such as attenuation, speed of sound, or mechanical properties such as stiffness and strain of the treatment region and suitably adjust the spatial and/or temporal characteristics and energy levels of the ultrasound therapy transducer of probe 204. The results of such monitoring techniques may be indicated on display 208 by means of one-, two, or three-dimensional images of monitoring results 250, or may simply comprise a success or fail-type indicator 252, or combinations thereof. Additional treatment monitoring techniques may be based on one or more of temperature, video, profilometry, and/or stiffness or strain gauges or any other suitable sensing technique.
The non-thermal effects from an acoustic field can also “shock” the sweat producing apocrine and eccrine cells in to reduced activity. These effects mentioned here as examples are, but not limited to, acoustic cavitation, acoustic streaming, inter-cellular shear effects, cell resonant effects, and the like.
In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, focused or directive ultrasound energy can be used for the treatment of sweat glands in the armpit (without the combination of pharmacological formulations). For example, a clinical indication would be to use in the management of Hidradenitis suppurativa. Ultrasound energy deposited at a selective depth can also be used in combination with a number of pharmaceutical formulations that are currently prescribed for the treatment of sweat gland hyperactivity in the axillary region, palms and soles. The ultrasound energy delivered to the target region in combination with the pharmaceutical agents such as BOTOX® or retinoids can help synergistically treat the sweat gland region by, (1) increasing activity of the agents due to the thermal and non-thermal mechanisms, (2) reduced requirement of overall drug dosage, as well as reducing the drug toxicity, (3) increase local effect of drug in a site selective manner.
An exemplary control system 202 and display system 208 may be configured in various manners for controlling probe and system functionality for providing the various exemplary treatment methods illustrated above. For example, with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, in accordance with exemplary embodiments, an exemplary control system 300 can be configured for coordination and control of the entire therapeutic treatment process to achieve the desired therapeutic effect of thermal ablation to treat a sweat gland. For example, control system 300 can suitably comprise power source components 302, sensing and monitoring components 304, cooling and coupling controls 306, and/or processing and control logic components 308. Control system 300 can be configured and optimized in a variety of ways with more or less subsystems and components to implement the therapeutic system for controlled thermal injury of sweat glands, and the embodiments in FIGS. 3A and 3B are merely for illustration purposes.
For example, for power sourcing components 302, control system 300 can comprise one or more direct current (DC) power supplies 303 configured to provide electrical energy for entire control system 300, including power required by a transducer electronic amplifier/driver 312. A DC current sense device 305 can also be provided to confirm the level of power going into amplifiers/drivers 312 for safety and monitoring purposes.
Amplifiers/drivers 312 can comprise multi-channel or single channel power amplifiers and/or drivers. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment for transducer array configurations, amplifiers/drivers 312 can also be configured with a beamformer to facilitate array focusing. An exemplary beamformer can be electrically excited by an oscillator/digitally controlled waveform synthesizer 310 with related switching logic.
The power sourcing components can also include various filtering configurations 314. For example, switchable harmonic filters and/or matching may be used at the output of amplifier/driver 312 to increase the drive efficiency and effectiveness. Power detection components 316 may also be included to confirm appropriate operation and calibration. For example, electric power and other energy detection components 316 may be used to monitor the amount of power going to an exemplary probe system.
Various sensing and monitoring components 304 may also be suitably implemented within control system 300. For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, monitoring, sensing and interface control components 324 may be configured to operate with various motion detection systems implemented within transducer probe 204 to receive and process information such as acoustic or other spatial and temporal information from a region of interest. Sensing and monitoring components can also include various controls, interfacing and switches 309 and/or power detectors 316. Such sensing and monitoring components 304 can facilitate open-loop and/or closed-loop feedback systems within treatment system 200.
Cooling/coupling control systems 306 may be provided to remove waste heat from an exemplary probe 204, provide a controlled temperature at the superficial tissue interface and deeper into tissue, and/or provide acoustic coupling from transducer probe 204 to region-of-interest 206. Such cooling/coupling control systems 306 can also be configured to operate in both open-loop and/or closed-loop feedback arrangements with various coupling and feedback components.

By the term “operated,” the electronic apertures of array 602 may be manipulated, driven, used, and/or configured to produce and/or deliver energy in a manner corresponding to the phase variation caused by the electronic time delay. For example, these phase variations can be used to deliver defocused beams, planar beams, and/or focused beams, each of which may be used in combination to achieve different physiological effects in ROI 610.
Transduction elements 606 may be configured to be concave, convex, and/or planar.

For example, such waves can be centered on-axis, such as by methods of adjusting corresponding transmit and/or receive delays, τ1, τ2, τ3 . . . τN. An electronic focus 1020 can be suitably moved along various depth positions, and can enable variable strength or beam tightness, while an electronic defocus can have varying amounts of defocusing. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a lens and/or convex or concave shaped annular array 1000 can also be provided to aid focusing or defocusing such that any time differential delays can be reduced. Movement of annular array 800 in one, two or three-dimensions, or along any path, such as through use of probes and/or any conventional robotic arm mechanisms, may be implemented to scan and/or treat a volume or any corresponding space within a region of interest.

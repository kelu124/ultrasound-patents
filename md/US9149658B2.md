BACKGROUND
Focused ultrasound surgery has tremendous potential compared to other energy based treatment modalities. Ultrasound energy can be placed deep into tissue at precise depths with highly controlled spatial distributions. However, one difficulty has been that the sub-millimeter or millimeter sized treatment region needs to be scanned to treat, image, or monitor a large volume or to produce fractionated treatment zones composed of multiple lesions. Attempts to address such problems have been via motorized and/or electronically scanned treat mechanisms. However, such methods and systems are limited in flexibility and coverage to the scanned volume, not only of the treatment region but regions for imaging and monitoring. Further, such methods typically require the patient to be constantly moved, such as in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided ultrasound treatment system, or alternatively the mechanism to be repositioned, with limited flexibility and accuracy. For example, if a treatment mechanism treats in a line, at fixed depth, and is scanned around the circumference of an essentially circular or curved object, such as a leg, arm, fingers, foot, etc., the lesions at the fixed depth will be spaced closer or further together, or even overlap, based on the convex or concave curvature of the surface as well as treatment depth. What is needed are new, sophisticated systems and methods for ultrasound treatment which provide increased accuracy and flexibility of treatment.
SUMMARY
Various embodiments of systems and methods for ultrasound treatment are provided. Accordingly, ultrasound treatments can include methods for soft tissue injuries and for orthopedic fibrous soft tissue surgical procedures.

With reference to FIG. 1, an extended field of view treatment system 147 is illustrated, according to various embodiments. Ultrasound probe 105 is in communications with treatment controller 148 via interface 142. Interface 142 can be a wired connection, a wireless connection or combinations thereof. In various embodiments, ultrasound probe 105 comprises therapy transducer array 100, and imaging transducer array 110. In various embodiments, therapy transducer array 100 is a transducer array comprising at least one active transduction element. In various embodiments, imaging transducer array 110 is a transducer array comprising at least one active imaging transduction element.
Ultrasound probe 105 can comprise enclosure 78, which can contain therapy transducer array 100, and imaging transducer array 110. In one embodiment, enclosure 78 is designed for comfort and control while used in an operator's hand. Enclosure 78 may also contain various electronics, EEPROM, switches, interface connections, motion mechanisms, acoustic coupling means, cooling means, thermal monitoring, and/or memory for holding programs.
Ultrasound probe 105 can comprise tip 88. Tip 88 can be coupled to enclosure 78. In one embodiment, tip 88 is disposable, and for example EEPROM determines if tip 88 has been used and can regulate further usage based upon prior usage. In some embodiments, tip 88 has height 89, which can control depth of therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 into subcutaneous tissue 109. In some embodiments, a plurality of tips 88, each having a different height 89 may be used to direct therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 to a plurality of depths in subcutaneous tissue 109.
Ultrasound probe 105 can be coupled to skin surface 104 to image and treat and monitor subcutaneous tissue 109. Subcutaneous tissue 109 can be any tissue that is below skin surface 104. For example, subcutaneous tissue 109 can include, is not limited to, any of epidermal layer, dermis layer, fat layer, cellulite, SMAS, a gland, a portion of hair, connective tissue, muscle, tendon, cartilage, or an organ, and combinations thereof. In various embodiments, therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 can be emitted by therapy transducer array 100 to create at least one treatment zone 112 in subcutaneous tissue 109. In various embodiments imaging ultrasound energy can be emitted and received by at least one of imaging transducer array 110 and therapy transducer array 100 to create a treatment monitoring area 116 in subcutaneous tissue 109. In one embodiment, imaging ultrasound energy can be emitted and received by imaging transducer array 110 to create an imaging area 115 in subcutaneous tissue 109. In various embodiments, monitoring area 116 can be a specialized signal-processing version of ultrasound imaging area 115, and thus where not explicitly mentioned, monitoring area 116 is implicitly included in the specification with reference to an imaging area 115.
In other embodiments ultrasound probe 105 is coupled to other tissue surfaces, such as an organ, as opposed to skin surface 104, to image, treat, and monitor subcutaneous tissue 109, such as the organ. For example, therapy transducer array 100 and imaging transducer array 110 can be integrated to or attached to a tool, such as, for example, an arthroscopic tool, laparoscopic tool, or an endoscopic tool that may be inserted into a patient's body with minimal invasiveness.
In various embodiments, ultrasound probe 105 can be moved in a direction 130, by hand or mechanism, to form a spatial sequence of the imaging area 115, namely image sequence 115A, 115B, . . . 115 n, and a spatial sequence of the monitoring area 116, namely monitoring sequence 116A, 116B, . . . 116 n, and so on. Overlapping images of image sequence 115A, 115B, . . . 115 n can be combined in treatment system via image processing techniques into an extended image 119, and rendered on display 146. The image sequence 115A, 115B, . . . 115 n provides real-time spatial position information such that as ultrasound probe 105 is moved 130, treatment system may trigger and create a spatial sequence of the treatment zone 112, namely treatment sequence 112A, 112B, . . . 112 n and so on. The extended field of view treatment sequence that is formed may constitute any preferred disposition of treatment lesions, such as multiple quantities, sizes, depths, types, etc. In addition, the monitoring sequence 116A, 116B, . . . 116 n can be combined into an extended monitoring image 121, overlaid, adjacent to, and analogous to extended image 119 for use as treatment feedback and/or display. The extended monitoring image 121 can be a specialized signal-processing version of extended image 119, and thus where not explicitly mentioned or annotated, extended monitoring image 121 is implicitly included in the specification with reference to an extended image 119. The extended field of view treatment sequence depth and position information can be overlaid atop the extended image 119 and shown on display 146. The extended images 119, extended treatment maps 150, extended treatment sequences 112, and extended monitoring images can be 2-D, 3-D or 4-dimensional. In various embodiments the extended image 119 provides information to dynamically, precisely, and accurately dispose a plurality of lesions 25, such as an equispaced plurality of lesions 25, even while scanning the surface of convex, concave, ellipsoidal, circular, essentially circular and other bodies of rotation, surfaces which closely represent human skin, appendages, and organs.

In one embodiment, enclosure 78 is designed for comfort and control while used in an operator's hand. Enclosure 78 may also contain various electronics, EEPROM, interface connections, motion mechanisms, and/or ram for holding programs.
In some embodiments, holder 137 operable to hold tip 88 to enclosure 78. Holder can comprise clip 138 and pivot 136. The holder 137 can be moved away from enclosure 78, so that tip 88 can be removed. Clip 138 holds tip 88 to enclosure 78. In one embodiment, holder 137 can comprise position sensor 107. In some embodiments, enclosure 78 comprises therapy transducer array 100. However, in other embodiments enclosure comprises therapy transducer array 100.
Now with reference to FIG. 12, ultrasound probe 105 is illustrated. In various embodiments, ultrasound probe 105 comprises enclosure 78 containing therapy transducer array 100, imaging transducer array 110, and optionally position sensor 107. Therapy transducer array 100 comprises at least one transducer element 125B. Ultrasound probe 105 can be coupled to skin surface 104. Therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 can be emitted by therapy transducer array 100 to create treatment zone 112 and second treatment zone 112A in subcutaneous tissue 109. In various embodiments, therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 can create treatment zone 112 and second treatment zone 112A.
Referring to FIG. 13, ultrasound sound probe that comprises two therapy transducer arrays is illustration according to various embodiments. Accordingly, ultrasound probe 105 comprises a first therapy transducer array 100 and a second therapy transducer array 100. Imaging transducer array 110 can be integrated to at least one of first therapy transducer array 100 and second therapy transducer array 100. In some embodiments, first therapy transducer array 100 and second therapy transducer array 100 create treatment zone 112 and second treatment zone 112A.
Moving to FIG. 14, a method of creating linear matrix of lesions is illustrated. In some embodiments, therapy transducer array 100 can be moved in direction 160 to provide a plurality of lesions 25 in a layer of subcutaneous tissue 109. In various embodiments, position sensor 107 may determine a distance 117 between pulses of therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 to create a plurality of lesions 25 which are evenly spaced or disposed in any spatial configuration in 1-D or 2-D patterns. As ultrasound probe 105 is moved in direction 160, position sensor 107 determines distance 117, regardless of a speed that ultrasound probe 105 is move, at which a pulse of therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 is to be emitted in to ROI. In some embodiments, distance 117 between lesions 25 can be less than distance 127 between treatment zones 112 of neighboring transduction elements 125. Further, therapy array 100 can be moved in orthogonal direction 130, or in any direction and angular attitude versus time.
However, if therapy transducer array 100 is configured with transduction element 125A, a 2-D pattern of a plurality of lesions 25 can be created. For example, each of the individual smaller transduction elements 120 may be controlled in a combination of different frequencies, different time periods, and different power levels to focus therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 to treatment zone 112 and focus therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 to a second treatment zone 112A as the therapy transducer array 100 is moved in direction 160.
Further, if therapy transducer array 100 is configured with transduction element 125B, a 2-D pattern of a plurality of lesions 25 can be created. For example, first transduction element 121 is operable to focus therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 to treatment zone 112 and second transduction element 122 is operable to focus therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 to second treatment zone 112A as transducer array 100 is moved in direction 160.
Now with reference to FIG. 15, extended field of view treatment system 147, according to various embodiments, is illustrated. In various embodiments, treatment system comprises controller 148, display 146, ultrasound probe 105, and interface 142 for communication between ultrasound probe 105 and controller 148.

In one embodiment, controller 148 is capable of coordination and control of the entire treatment process to achieve the desired therapeutic effect on ROI. For example, in one embodiment, controller 148 may comprise power source components, sensing and monitoring components, one or more RF driver circuits, cooling and coupling controls, and/or processing and control logic components. Controller 148 may be configured and optimized in a variety of ways with more or less subsystems and components to implement extended field of view treatment system 147 for controlled targeting of a portion of subcutaneous tissue 109, and the embodiments in FIG. 15 are merely for illustration purposes.
For example, for power sourcing components, controller 148 may comprise one or more direct current (DC) power supplies capable of providing electrical energy for the entire controller 148, including power required by a transducer electronic amplifier/driver. A DC current sense or voltage sense device may also be provided to confirm the level of power entering amplifiers/drivers for safety and monitoring purposes.
In one embodiment, amplifiers/drivers may comprise multi-channel or single channel power amplifiers and/or drivers. In one embodiment for transducer array configurations, amplifiers/drivers may also be configured with a beamformer to facilitate array focusing.

In one embodiment, sensing and monitoring components may further comprise a sensor that may be connected to an audio or visual alarm system to prevent overuse of system. In this embodiment, the sensor may be capable of sensing the amount of energy transferred to the skin, and/or the time that extended field of view treatment system 147 has been actively emitting energy. When a certain time or temperature threshold has been reached, the alarm may sound an audible alarm, or cause a visual indicator to activate to alert the user that a threshold has been reached. This may prevent overuse of treatment system 147. In one embodiment, the sensor may be operatively connected to controller 148 and force controller 148, to stop emitting therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 from ultrasound probe 105.
Additionally, an exemplary controller 148 may further comprise a system processor and various digital control logic, such as one or more of microcontrollers, microprocessors, field-programmable gate arrays, computer boards, and associated components, including firmware and control software, which may be capable of interfacing with user controls and interfacing circuits as well as input/output circuits and systems for communications, displays, interfacing, storage, documentation, and other useful functions.

Further, various control switches, touch panels, multi-touch panels, capacitive and inductive switches, may also be suitably configured to control operation.
With reference again to FIG. 15, an exemplary treatment system 147 also may comprise display 146 capable of providing images of ROI in various embodiments where ultrasound energy may be emitted from ultrasound probe 105 in a manner for imaging. In one embodiment, display 146 is a computer monitor. Display 146 may be capable of enabling the user to facilitate localization of treatment area and surrounding structures, for example, identification of subcutaneous tissue layer 109. In an alternative embodiment, the user may know the location of the specific subcutaneous tissue layer 109 to be treated based at least in part upon prior experience or education and without display 146. In another embodiment, display 146 also includes a touch screen to allow user touch- or multi-touch input in a graphical user interface. In yet another embodiment display 146 is a 3-D display.
After localization, therapeutic ultrasound energy 108 is delivered at a depth, distribution, timing, and energy level to achieve the desired therapeutic effect at ROI to treat injury. Before, during and/or after delivery of therapeutic ultrasound energy 108, monitoring of the treatment area and surrounding structures may be conducted to further plan and assess the results and/or provide feedback to controller 148, and to a system operator via display 146.
Feedback information may be generated or provided by any one or more acoustical sources, such as B-scan images, A-lines, Doppler or color flow images, surface acoustic wave devices, hydrophones, elasticity measurement, or shear wave based devices. In addition, optical sources can also be utilized, such as video and/or infrared cameras, laser Doppler imagers, optical coherence tomography imagers, and temperature sensors. Further, feedback information can also be provided by semiconductors, such as thermistors or solid state temperature sensors, by electronic and electromagnetic sensors, such as impedance and capacitance measurement devices and/or thermocouples, and by mechanical sensors, such as stiffness gages, strain gages or stress measurement sensors, or any suitably combination thereof.

Tip 88 is coupled to skin surface 104 with an acoustic coupling agent. In addition, a microcontroller and timing circuits with associated software and algorithms provide control and user interfacing via a display or LED-type indicators 83, and other input/output controls 82, such as switches and audio devices. A storage element, such as an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (“EEPROM”), secure EEPROM, tamper-proof EEPROM, or similar device can hold calibration and usage data. A motion mechanism with feedback can be controlled to scan the transducer array 100 in a linear pattern or a two-dimensional pattern or over a varied depth. Other feedback controls comprise capacitive, acoustic, or other coupling detection means, limiting controls, and thermal sensor.

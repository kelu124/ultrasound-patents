In some embodiments, a delay between the different sub sections (also known as pieces or elements) can be controlled by phase differences between the independent sub sections. In some embodiments, a delay between different subsections can be controlled by timing differences between independent subsections. In some embodiments, delay be between different subsections can be controlled by the use of different lenses on each of the subsections.
In some embodiments, an ultrasound treatment system can comprise: a ultrasound transducer comprising a subdivided surface comprising a plurality of electronically isolated pieces; a power source coupled to at least two of the pieces, wherein the power supply is configured to independently shape a temporal delay or a spatial delay, as compared to each other, of acoustic energy emitted from the at least two pieces; wherein each of the at least two pieces shape the acoustic energy, independently, into a thermal zone in subcutaneous tissue.
In some embodiments the at least two pieces are configured to not provide electronic focusing of the acoustic energy into a single location in the subcutaneous tissue. In some aspects, each of the plurality of isolated pieces have a dimension greater than 2 wavelengths. In some aspects, each of the plurality of isolated pieces have a dimension greater than 5 wavelengths. The plurality of isolated pieces is focused to an independent and separate spot in the subcutaneous tissue. The plurality of isolated pieces are configured to not focus in one spot. The acoustic energy emitted by each of the plurality of isolated pieces is a non-additive transmission of the acoustic energy.
In some embodiments an insulator material can be positioned between each of the plurality of pieces. A holder comprising the insulator material can be configured to reposition at least a portion of the plurality of isolated pieces.
In one example, the plurality of isolated pieces is 3 pieces, wherein a center piece is coupled to the power source and the two side pieces are coupled in parallel to the power supply, wherein the power supply is configured to independently shape a temporal delay or a spatial delay, of the acoustic energy emitted by the center piece as compared to the acoustic energy emitted by the two side pieces.
The a power source can be coupled to each of the plurality of isolated pieces, wherein the power supply is configured to independently shape a temporal delay or a spatial delay, as compared to each other, of acoustic energy emitted from each of the plurality of isolated pieces.

Each of the plurality of isolated pieces is focused to an independent and separate spot in the subcutaneous tissue.
Now with reference to FIG. 2, a transducer apparatus 25 can be sectioned in to multiple pieces. For example, the transducer apparatus 25 can be sectioned into four equivalent pieces as indicated in FIG. 2 by piece 1, piece 2, piece 3, and piece 4. In various embodiments, the transducer apparatus 25 can be sectioned into 3 pieces, or 5 pieces, or 6 pieces, or n pieces. However, sectioning transducer apparatus 25 into 3 to 8 pieces is preferred; which allows for larger pieces, which can provide treatment to a region of interest in subcutaneous tissue.
Each of the pieces, are large enough to generate planar waves. Accordingly, transducer apparatus 25 is not a phased array. Furthermore, transducer apparatus 25 is not a annular array. For example, a phased array is a combination of elements which are between a quarter wavelength to one wavelength to enable electronic focusing of the acoustic energy. However, transducer apparatus 25 does not focus elements to one spot. Each of the pieces or elements are independent from each other. Accordingly, transducer apparatus 25 will not focus energy to multiple spots if the pieces are elements are within a quarter light wavelength to one wavelength of each other. Transducer apparatus 25 subdivided into multiple pieces are elements that are least several wavelengths in dimension. Each of the elements of transducer apparatus 25 is independent and large enough to transmit a planar wave. The transmission of energy is not additive transmission but rather multiple independent emissions or transmissions.
Again with reference to FIG. 2, transducer apparatus 25 can have a serious of lines etched into outer surface which are configured to have each of the pieces electrically independent from each other. In some embodiments as illustrated in FIG. 3 the pieces may be separated by an insulator material. As such, the pieces of transducer apparatus 26 can be held in a holder made of insulated insulator material 18. The holder, can Change positions of the pieces such that there moved from their original radius to direct the focus of the acoustic energy in a desired spot. The holder can spatially divide the pieces are elements into a pattern that may position the energy at different depths in the region of interest. Accordingly, the transducer apparatus 26 can be configured to provide or deliver energy in multiple planes of tissue in the region of interest. With reference to figs two and three, the elements are pieces can be driven are driven independently. For example pieces than one in three may be driven out of phase of pieces four and two. In addition, each of the pieces can have different temporal parameters and as such can be fired to deliver acoustic bursts of energy simultaneously, in a random pattern, or sequentially.
As illustrated in FIG. 4, transducer apparatus 26 can emit multiple beams of ultrasound energy. Each of the pieces of transducer apparatus 26 has a different focal point. Each of the pieces can coupled to a power source configured to cause the piece to emit ultrasound energy at a desired frequency. For example, transducer apparatus 26 can emit ultrasound energy 33 from piece 3, ultrasound energy 22 from piece 2, ultrasound energy 44 from piece 4, and ultrasound energy 11 from piece 1. In various examples, piece 1 can focus ultrasound energy 11 to cause a thermal zone at focal point 10, piece 2 can focus ultrasound energy 22 to cause a thermal zone at focal point 20, piece 3 can focus ultrasound energy 33 to cause a thermal zone at focal point 30, and piece 4 can focus ultrasound energy 44 to cause a thermal zone at focal point 40. However, any of the pieces may be driven to cause a mechanical effect at the focal point or in the region of interest proximate thereto.
As illustrated in FIG. 5, a pattern of acoustic treatment is illustrated. Exemplary pattern of acoustic treatment generates a plurality of treatments zones. The transducer apparatus 26 can generate a first set of treatments zones as represented by the circles. As the transducer apparatus 26 moves, a second set of treatments zones may be generated, as represented by the triangles. As the transducer apparatus 26 moves farther, a third set of treatments owns a be generated, as represented by the squares. As illustrated the three sets of treatments owns are symmetrical. However, transducer for certain apparatus 26 can be our can generate treatments owns in a random pattern.
As illustrated in FIG. 7, a pattern of acoustic treatment is illustrated. Once again, an exemplary pattern of acoustic treatment generates a plurality of treatment sounds. The transducer apparatus 26 can generate a first set of treatments owns, as represented by the circles. Again as the transducer apparatus 26 is moved, a second set of treatments zones may be generated, as represented by the triangles. As the transducer apparatus 26 is moved farther, a third set of treatments zones may be generated, as represented by the squares. With reference to FIG. 7, one of the first set of treatments owns as represented by a circle has received a second delivery of energy to create the treatment zone that overlaps with the third set of treatment zones. The treatment apparatus 26 can be moved farther along the surface above a region of interest, a fourth set of treatments owns may be generated as represented by the pentagons. One of the second set of treatments owns as represented by the triangle has received a second delivery of energy to create a treatment zone that overlaps with the fourth set of treatments owns. Any pattern of treatments owns may be generated in such a pattern can be at the same depth or maybe at multiple depths.
As illustrated in FIG. 6, an alternative embodiment of transducer apparatus 26 can comprise a ring of pieces such as piece 5, piece 6, piece 7, and piece 8 positioned around transducer apparatus 25. Of course, any number pieces can be employed in transducer apparatus 25 or transducer apparatus 26. The position focal points created by a transducer apparatus can be determined by the insulted frame 18. The position of the focal points can be spread out or relatively close to each depending on the configuration of insulated frame 18. Moving to FIG. 8, a second alternative embodiment of transducer apparatus 26 can comprise a ring of pieces such as piece 5, piece 6, piece 7, and piece 8 positioned around transducer apparatus 25. Of course, the configuration of the pieces one through eight may not require the insulated holder 18. In some embodiments, the transducer apparatus 26 may be sectioned into pieces by cuts in ceramic material of the transducer element.
Moving to FIGS. 9-12, another embodiment of the transducer assembly 25 is illustrated. In some embodiments the individual pieces 1-3 can be equivalent distances along a day Amber along the diameter of the transducer element. The cross-section of the transducer apparatus 25 illustrates three different emissions of the ultrasound energy in some embodiments, piece one and piece three can be driven together and piece three driven independently. Some embodiments, the apparatus 25 can create a plurality of thermal zones in a region of interest 110. For example as illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12, pieces one into generate thermal zone 71 and 72 and piece three generates thermal zone 75. In some examples, the transducer assembly 25 may be driven a piece 3 and only thermal zone 75 is created. However, in other examples, the transducer assembly 25 may be driven at peace land piece 1 and thermal zones 71 and 72 can be created. The timing between pieces one and two two-piece three is different, and is controllable.
In another alternative embodiment, the transducer apparatus 28 comprises a flat transducer 39 and three lenses. As illustrated in FIG. 13, lens 53 can generate ultrasound energy 33 with the focus at 30.

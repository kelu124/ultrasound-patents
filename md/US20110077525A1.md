CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 
 [0001]  The present application claims the benefit of a co-pending provisional patent application entitled “Ultrasound for Orthopedic Application” which was filed on May 7, 2009, and assigned Ser. No. 61/176,373. The entire content of the foregoing provisional application is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND
 [0002]  1. Technical Field
  [0003]  The present disclosure relates generally to equipment and procedures in the field of spinal surgery and, in exemplary implementations, to instruments, systems and methods for positioning and/or evaluating the positioning of pedicle screws in connection with orthopedic applications.
  [0004]  2. Background Art
  [0005]  Surgical techniques for spinal fixation vary widely in terms of the types of surgical equipment used, but modern surgical practice continues to rely quite heavily on the strength and stability afforded by the common pedicle screw. However, care must be taken during pedicle screw placement to protect against nerve damage. For example, after forming a pilot hole in the bone tissue of a pedicle but before moving forward with pedicle screw implantation, a surgeons will typically take the opportunity to inspect the axially-extending side walls of the pilot hole to locate defects. With the advent and increasing use of minimally invasive surgical procedures that afford only a limited view with respect to anatomical structure, the risk of misplaced pedicle screws has increased. In the event a surgeon locates a breach of any significant size the cortical bone adjacent the spinal column, he or she will mostly likely elect to redirect the screw to avoid the risk of complications such as pain, paralysis and hemorrhaging.
  [0006]  One method for locating such cortical breaches in regular use by surgeons is tissue palpation by means of the common tactile feeler probe. While all surgeons are aware that this method has its limitations, including with regard to sensitivity in the case of relatively small breaches, as well as with regard to false positives, many if not most have become comfortable with the use of the tactile feeler probe. To the extent techniques and tools can be developed to facilitate continued effective use of tactile diagnostic techniques in the context of minimally invasive spinal surgical procedures, there is likely to be a strong market for same among current practitioners.
  [0007]  Recent developments in the use of ultrasound technology in surgical applications have shown promise. With the increasing miniaturization of electronics generally has come the ability to position ultrasound transducers to beneficial effect in increasingly smaller and, at least up until recently, harder to reach anatomical locations. Nevertheless, and despite efforts to date, a need remains for convenient, sanitary, low-cost, and effective equipment and related techniques for locating pilot hole bone tissue defects prior to pedicle screw implantation.
  [0008]  These and other needs are satisfied by the instruments, systems and methods disclosed herein, as will be apparent from the detailed description which follows, particularly when read in conjunction with the figures appended hereto.
 SUMMARY
 [0009]  The present disclosure provides advantageous instruments, systems and methods for obtaining and/or determining anatomical information, e.g., locating pilot hole bone tissue defects prior to pedicle screw implantation. In exemplary embodiments, a medical diagnostic instrument is provided that includes (i) a proximal handle configured and dimensioned to permit an operator to manually grasp the instrument; (ii) an ultrasound probe including a longitudinal shaft extending distally from the handle and terminating in a distal end, and an ultrasound transducer mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft proximate the distal end thereof, the ultrasound transducer including an array of ultrasonic energy generation elements; and (iii) a tactile feeler probe mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe, the tactile feeler probe including a longitudinal shaft mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and extending distally beyond the distal end thereof, and a feeler probe tip (e.g., a ball tip) defined at a distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe.
  [0010]  The ultrasound transducer and the distal end are generally cooperatively configured, oriented, and dimensioned to permit the operator to insert the ultrasound transducer and the distal end into a desired anatomical location to permit the operator to obtain thereat a corresponding two-dimensional image of the anatomical location for visual inspection by the operator for purposes of detecting ultrasonically-detectable anatomical properties. The array of ultrasonic energy generation elements may be side-firing and may be oriented in a linear array or a phased array. In addition, the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe are generally cooperatively configured and dimensioned to permit the operator to insert the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe into the desired anatomical location to permit the operator to perform thereat a tactile inspection of the selected anatomical location.
  [0011]  The disclosed medical diagnostic instrument may be advantageously employed in connection with a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of the human patient. In addition, the array of ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer may extend axially along, and be positioned against, a selected portion of a side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole. The feeler probe tip may be positioned against the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole. The medical diagnostic instrument may also include at least one channel configured and dimensioned to receive a K-wire to permit the instrument to be slidably mounted thereto for purposes of guiding the ultrasound and tactile feeler probes axially relative to the desired anatomical location. Thus, the channel may be in the handle and extend therethrough, and/or be formed in an extension of the handle and extend therepast. The handle and the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe may be of unitary construction or the ultrasonic probe may be mounted with respect to the handle such that the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasonic probe is supported, cantilever-style, by the handle housing. In addition, the tactile feeler probe may be mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe such that the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe is supported, cantilever-style, by the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe.
  [0012]  The disclosed medical diagnostic instrument is typically adapted to cooperate with a cable assembly for carrying electrical signals to and from the ultrasound transducer in accordance with an ultrasonic imaging mode of use of the instrument. The cable assembly generally includes a proximal end including an electrical connector for connecting the instrument to a corresponding ultrasound console and current carrying wires extending distally from the electrical connector to the ultrasound transducer at least partially via a corresponding interior conduit formed in and extending longitudinally along the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe. The current carrying wires also generally extend to the ultrasound transducer through the proximal end of the handle and through a corresponding interior conduit formed in and extending longitudinally along the longitudinal shaft of the handle.
  [0013]  The array of ultrasonic energy generation elements generally defines an axial length along the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe of between about 8 millimeters and about 12 millimeters. In addition, the tactile feeler probe typically extends distally beyond the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe such that the longitudinal shaft and the feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe collectively define an axial length of the tactile feeler probe beyond the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of between about 8 millimeters and about 12 millimeters.
  [0014]  The present disclosure also advantageously provides a medical diagnostic system for use in conjunction with bone tissue that includes:
  [0015]  a medical diagnostic instrument, the instrument including (i) a handle disposed proximate an operator of the instrument, the handle being configured and dimensioned to permit the operator to manually grasp the instrument and manipulate the instrument relative to the spine of a human patient; (ii) an ultrasound probe that includes a longitudinal shaft extending distally from the handle and terminating in a distal end, and an ultrasound transducer mounted to the longitudinal shaft proximate the distal end thereof, the ultrasound transducer including an array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extending along the longitudinal shaft, wherein the ultrasound transducer and the distal end are cooperatively configured, oriented, and dimensioned to permit the operator to insert the ultrasound transducer and the distal end into a desired anatomical location (e.g., a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of the human patient) such that the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer extends axially along, and is positioned against, a selected portion of the anatomical location, (iii) a tactile feeler probe mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe, the tactile feeler probe including a longitudinal shaft mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and extending distally therefrom beyond the distal end thereof, and a feeler probe tip defined at a distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe, the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe being cooperatively configured and dimensioned to permit the operator to insert the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe into the desired anatomical location (e.g., a pedicle screw pilot hole) such that the feeler probe tip is positioned against the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole, and to permit the operator to perform thereat a tactile inspection of the desired anatomical location; and (iv) a first cable assembly for carrying electrical signals to and from the ultrasound transducer in accordance with an ultrasonic imaging mode of use of the instrument, the cable assembly including a proximal end including a first electrical connector for connecting the instrument to a corresponding ultrasound console and current carrying wires extending distally from the electrical connector, through the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and to the ultrasound transducer. The disclosed system may further include and/or be adapted to operate with an ultrasound console including a processor for controlling the medical diagnostic instrument, a display for displaying two-dimensional ultrasonic images obtained therefrom by an operator thereof, and a port for receiving a corresponding cable connector; and a second cable assembly for carrying electrical signals to and from the ultrasound console, the second cable assembly including a second electrical connector coupled to a the port associated with the ultrasound console, a third electrical connector coupled to the first electrical connector, and current carrying wires extending therebetween.
  [0016]  Still further, the present disclosure provides an advantageous method of exploring a desired anatomical location (e.g., a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of a human patient for cortical breaches located in the axially-extending side-walls thereof) that includes:
  [0017]  presenting a medical diagnostic instrument that includes (i) a handle, (ii) an ultrasound probe that includes a longitudinal shaft extending distally from the handle and terminating in a distal end, and an ultrasound transducer mounted to the longitudinal shaft proximate the distal end thereof, the ultrasound transducer including an array of ultrasonic energy generation elements (e.g., side-firing) extending along the longitudinal shaft; and (iii) a tactile feeler probe mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe, the tactile feeler probe including a longitudinal shaft mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and extending distally therefrom beyond the distal end thereof, and a feeler probe tip defined at a distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe;
  [0018]  employing the handle to manually grasp and manipulate the medical diagnostic instrument relative to the desired anatomical location (e.g., the spine of a human patient), including inserting the ultrasound transducer and the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe, and the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe into the desired anatomical location;
  [0019]  positioning the array of ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer relative to the desired anatomical location;
  [0020]  employing the array of ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer to obtain a two-dimensional image of the desired anatomical location;
  [0021]  positioning the feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe relative to the desired anatomical location;
  [0022]  employing the feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe to perform a tactile inspection of the desired anatomical location; and
  [0023]  performing the two positioning and the two employing steps without removing any of the ultrasound transducer or the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe or the feeler probe tip of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe from the desired anatomical location.
  [0024]  Additional features, functions and benefits of the present disclosure will be apparent from the detailed description which follows, particularly when read in conjunction with the accompanying figures.

  [0044]  Referring now to FIG. 1, a medical diagnostic system 101 in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. The system 101 includes a medical diagnostic instrument 103 which may include a first cable assembly 105. The system 103 also includes an ultrasound console 107 and a second cable assembly 109.
  [0045]  The instrument 103 includes a handle 111. The handle 111 is disposable proximate an operator (not shown) of the instrument 103 and is configured and dimensioned to permit the operator (not shown) to manually grasp the instrument 103, and to manipulate the instrument 103 relative to the spine of a human patient (not shown).
  [0046]  The instrument 103 further includes an ultrasound probe 113. The ultrasound probe 113 includes a longitudinal shaft 115 extending distally from the handle 111 and terminating in a distal end 117. The ultrasound probe 113 further includes an ultrasound transducer 119 mounted to the longitudinal shaft 115 proximate the distal end 117 thereof. The ultrasound transducer 119 includes an array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements (not separately shown) extending along the longitudinal shaft 115.
  [0047]  The ultrasound transducer 119 and the distal end 117 are cooperatively configured, oriented, and dimensioned to permit the operator (not shown) to insert the ultrasound transducer 119 and the distal end 117 into a pedicle screw pilot hole (not shown) formed in the spine of the human patient (not shown) such that the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer 119 extends axially along, and is positioned against, a selected portion of a side wall (not shown) of the pedicle screw pilot hole, and to permit the operator to obtain thereat a corresponding two-dimensional image (not shown) of the selected portion of the side wall for visual inspection by the operator for purposes of detecting ultrasonically-detectable cortical breaches located therein (not shown).
  [0048]  The instrument 103 further includes a tactile feeler probe 121 mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe 113, the tactile feeler probe 121 including a longitudinal shaft 123 mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 and extending distally therefrom beyond the distal end 117 thereof, and a feeler probe tip 125 defined at a distal end 127 of the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121, the feeler probe tip 125 and the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 being cooperatively configured and dimensioned to permit the operator (not shown) to insert the feeler probe tip 125 and the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 into the pedicle screw pilot hole (not shown) such that the feeler probe tip 125 is positioned against the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole (not shown), and to permit the operator to perform thereat a tactile inspection of the selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole for purposes of detecting manually detectable cortical breaches located therein (not shown).
  [0049]  As indicated above, the instrument 103 may further include a first cable assembly 105. The first cable assembly 105 may be configured and arranged to carry electrical signals to and from the ultrasound transducer 119 in accordance with an ultrasonic imaging mode of use of the instrument 103. The first cable assembly 105 may include a proximal end 129 including a first electrical connector 131 for connecting the instrument 103 to a corresponding ultrasound console 107 and current carrying wires (not separately shown) extending distally from the electrical connector 131, through the longitudinal shaft 123 of the ultrasound probe 113 and to the ultrasound transducer 119.
  [0050]  The ultrasound console 107 includes a processor 133 for controlling the instrument 103, a display 135 for displaying two-dimensional ultrasonic images obtained from the instrument 103 by an operator thereof, and a port 137 for receiving a corresponding cable connector.
  [0051]  As indicated above, the system 101 includes a second cable assembly 109 for carrying electrical signals to and from the ultrasound console 107. The second cable assembly 109 includes a second electrical connector 139 coupled to a the port 137 associated with the ultrasound console 107, a third electrical connector 141 coupled to the first electrical connector 131, and current carrying wires (not separately shown) extending therebetween.
  [0052]  The connection between the third electrical connector 141 of the second cable assembly 109 and the first electrical connector 131 of the first cable assembly may be an umbilical connection between a disposable portion 143 of the medical diagnostic system 101 including the medical diagnostic instrument 103, and a non-disposable portion 145 of the medical diagnostic system 101 including the ultrasound console 107 and the second cable assembly 109.
  [0053]  Turning now to FIGS. 1 and 2, the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 may define a longitudinal axis 201 along which the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 extends distally from the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113, and a longitudinal axis 203 along which the longitudinal shaft 123 of the tactile feeler probe 121 extends distally to the feeler probe tip 125, and a bend 205 formed therebetween such that the longitudinal axis 201 and the longitudinal axis 203 collectively define a first plane (represented in FIG. 2 by the plane in which FIG. 2 appears). The longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 may define a longitudinal axis 207 along which the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 extends distally from the handle 111. The side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the array thereof (not separately shown) may define a longitudinal axis 209 along which the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extends.
  [0054]  As indicated in FIG. 2 at reference numeral 211, the longitudinal axis 209 associated with the side-firing ultrasonic energy elements of the array thereof may be radially offset from the longitudinal axis 207 associated with the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113. In such circumstances, the longitudinal axis 207 and the longitudinal axis 209 may collectively define a second plane (represented in FIG. 2 by the plane in which FIG. 2 appears) that is coplanar with the first plane.
  [0055]  As indicated in FIG. 2 at reference numeral 213, the feeler probe tip 125 may be radially offset from the longitudinal axis 207 associated with the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113. In such circumstances, each of the feeler probe tip 125 and the longitudinal axis 209 associated with the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements may be offset from the longitudinal axis 207 in a common radial direction therefrom such that the feeler probe tip 125 and the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements are rotationally aligned with each other relative to the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113. Alternatively (not shown in FIG. 2), the feeler probe tip 125 may be disposed on the longitudinal axis 207 associated with the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113.
  [0056]  Still referring to FIG. 2, the handle 111 may include a longitudinal shaft 215 extending proximally from the ultrasound probe 113 and terminate in a proximal end 217. The longitudinal shaft 215 may define a longitudinal axis 219 along which the handle 111 extends proximally from the ultrasound probe 113. As shown in FIG. 2, the longitudinal axis 217 may be disposed in the first plane (represented in FIG. 2 by the plane in which FIG. 2 appears). In such circumstances, the longitudinal axis 219 associated with the handle may be positioned and oriented coaxially with respect to the longitudinal axis 207 associated with the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 such that the handle 211 and the ultrasound probe 113 are longitudinally aligned with each other.
  [0057]  As indicated in FIG. 2 at reference numeral 221, the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements may define an axial length along the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 of between about 8 millimeters and about 12 millimeters. For example, the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements may define an axial length along the longitudinal shaft 115 of the ultrasound probe 113 of about 10 millimeters.

  [0082]  Based on the foregoing test results, including specifically the noted human cadaveric tests, the following conclusions have been reached:
   The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods (pedicle ultrasound) has a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value as compared to the “classic” pedicle feeler. The noted difference is greater with extremely small breaches (2.5 mm vs. 4.0 mm) With larger breaches (4.0 mm), the detection of breaches approaches a sensitivity and specificity of 100% using the pedicle ultrasound system. The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods facilitate screening tests and/or related diagnostics to determine/detect whether a breach in cortical bone has occurred when placing pedicle screws into the spine. The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods allow surgeons and other health care personnel to reduce the likelihood that pedicle screws will be misplaced in spinal surgery, thereby translating to more effective health care.   

  [0088]  In operation, and as illustrated in FIGS. 56 and 57, the above described diagnostic instruments may be used to explore a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of a human patient for cortical breaches located in the axially-extending side-walls thereof As shown in FIGS. 56 and 57, a medical diagnostic instrument 6001 in accordance with the present disclosure is presented. The instrument includes a handle, an ultrasound probe, and a tactile feeler probe. The ultrasound probe includes a longitudinal shaft extending distally from the handle and terminating in a distal end, and an ultrasound transducer mounted to the longitudinal shaft proximate the distal end thereof The ultrasound transducer includes an array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extending along the longitudinal shaft.
  [0089]  The tactile feeler probe is mounted with respect to the ultrasound probe and includes a longitudinal shaft mounted with respect to the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe and extending distally therefrom beyond the distal end thereof The tactile feeler probe includes a feeler probe tip defined at a distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe.
  [0090]  The handle is employed to manually grasp and manipulate the medical diagnostic instrument relative to the spine of a human patient, including inserting the ultrasound transducer and the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the ultrasound probe, and the feeler probe tip and the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe into a pedicle screw pilot hole formed in the spine of the human patient.
  [0091]  The feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe is positioned relative to a selected portion of the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole such that the feeler probe tip is positioned against the side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole.
  [0092]  The feeler probe tip of the tactile feeler probe is employed to perform a tactile inspection of the selected portion of the side wall for purposes of detecting manually-detectable cortical breaches located therein.
  [0093]  The array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer are positioned relative to selected portion of a side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole such that the array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements extends axially along, and is positioned against, the selected portion of a side wall of the pedicle screw pilot hole.
  [0094]  The array of side-firing ultrasonic energy generation elements of the ultrasound transducer is employed to obtain a two-dimensional image of the selected portion of the side wall for visual inspection for purposes of detecting ultrasonically-detectable cortical breaches located therein.
  [0095]  The two positioning and the two array employment steps are performed without removing any of the ultrasound transducer or the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe or the feeler probe tip of the longitudinal shaft of the tactile feeler probe from the pedicle screw pilot hole.
  [0096]  The instrument may be mounted and slid along a K-wire (not specifically shown) to guide the ultrasound and tactile feeler probes axially relative to the pedicle screw pilot hole during a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Alternatively, and/or in addition, the instrument may be mounted with respect to one or more guide wires other than a K-wire.
  [0097]  With reference to FIGS. 58-59, a further implementation according to the present disclosure is shown. Thus, a modified Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 may be employed with an ultrasound probe assembly in clinical applications, e.g., to detect/determine a breach in the cortical bone associated with pedicle screw placement. The Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 generally takes the form of a long hollow needle 7006 with a tapered cutting edge at a distal end thereof. A handle 7004 is mounted with respect to the needle 7006 and defines an aperture for receipt of an inner needle (not pictured) and ancillary element(s). In conventional use of a Jamshidi-style needle, the inner needle may be removed once a desired anatomical location is reached and a syringe may be introduced through the aperture formed in the handle for use in sampling tissue, e.g., bone marrow. However, in the exemplary implementation disclosed herein, after removal of the inner needle (not pictured), the aperture formed in handle 7004 of Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 is configured and dimensioned to receive an elongated ultrasound probe 7010 associated with ultrasound assembly 7002. In exemplary implementations, the ultrasound assembly 7002 includes a handle member 7008 that defines a fitting for connection to conventional cabling.
  [0098]  In use, the Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 is introduced to a desired clinical location, e.g., within cortical bone that has been pre-drilled for receipt of a pedicle screw, and the inner needle (not pictured) is removed. Ultrasound probe 7010 is then introduced through the aperture formed in the handle 7004 of the Jamshidi-style needle assembly 7001 for advantageous ultrasound detection of relevant information, e.g., a breach of the cortical bone. In exemplary implementations, needle 7006 is approximately 7.5 cm in length and the inner diameter of needle 7006 is approximately 3 mm. Alternative dimensions may be employed without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.
  [0099]  Although the systems, apparatus and methods have been described with respect to exemplary embodiments herein, it is apparent that modifications, variations, changes and/or enhancements may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, as an alternative to the use of a side-firing ultrasound transducer as described hereinabove, and/or in addition thereto, one or more end-firing ultrasound transducers, and/or 360 degree ultrasound transducers may be employed, whether mounted with respect to the distal end of the longitudinal shaft of the associated ultrasound probe, adjacent thereto, or otherwise, for use as desired by the surgical practitioner. Ultrasound probes and systems in accordance with the present disclosure may employ or embody one or more of a variety of modes of ultrasound, including but not necessarily limited to Ultrasound Mode A, Ultrasound Mode B, Ultrasound Mode M, Ultrasound DM Mode, as well as color and three-dimensional modes. Other instruments may be modularly attached in addition to, and/or in place of a tactile feeler probe, including but not limited to curettes, nerve hooks, Woodsons, and/or Murphey Balls.

## Abstract

Abstract

An ultrasonic diagnostic device comprising an ADC (60) that
converts signals to digital format, a time axis extension unit (70) that is
capable of writing and reading the digital data, a data compression unit
(80) that compresses the read data, a memory unit (90) that stores the
compressed data, a data expanding unit that expands the compressed
data stored in the memory unit, and a DAC (110) that converts the
expanded data from a digital format to an analog format, wherein optimum
images can be displayed for diagnosis by means of filtering,
logarithmically converting, and detecting before inputting the data into the
digital scan converter (210).

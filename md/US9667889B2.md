## Abstract

Abstract

A portable electronic device (e.g., smart phone or tablet computer) is provided for generating and displaying images (e.g., 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional images) of an imaging target such as a human body. The portable electronic device may include imaging elements configured to receive radiation signals transmitted through and/or reflected by the imaging target, an imaging interface, and one or more processors. The portable electronic device may display what appears to be a window into the imaging target (e.g., a human body), and/or an exploded view (e.g., 3-dimensional, upwardly projected image) of the target. The generated image may be a real-time continuous image of the internal features of the target (e.g., a human body) that is updated to track movements of the target (e.g., breathing patterns) and the relative position of the portable electronic device as the portable electronic device moves relative to a surface of the target.



A portable electronic device (e.g., smart phone or tablet computer) is provided for generating and displaying images (e.g., 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional images) of an imaging target such as a human body. The portable electronic device may include imaging elements configured to receive radiation signals transmitted through and/or reflected by the imaging target, an imaging interface, and one or more processors. The portable electronic device may display what appears to be a window into the imaging target (e.g., a human body), and/or an exploded view (e.g., 3-dimensional, upwardly projected image) of the target. The generated image may be a real-time continuous image of the internal features of the target (e.g., a human body) that is updated to track movements of the target (e.g., breathing patterns) and the relative position of the portable electronic device as the portable electronic device moves relative to a surface of the target.

FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY
The present disclosure relates generally to imaging devices and methods (e.g., ultrasound imaging devices and methods).
BACKGROUND
Imaging technologies are used at various stages of medical care. For example, imaging technologies are used to non-invasively diagnose patients, to monitor the performance of medical (e.g., surgical) procedures, and/or to monitor post-treatment progress or recovery.
Conventional imaging devices and methods, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, are typically configured for and limited to use within a fixed location in a hospital setting. MRI technology is also generally slow, and suffers from other drawbacks including high cost, loud noise, and the use of potentially harmful magnetic fields.
In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide portable electronic devices and associated methods with integrated imaging capabilities.
SUMMARY
Some embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a portable electronic device (e.g., smart phone and/or tablet computer) for generating and displaying an image (e.g., 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional image) of what appears to be a window into an underlying object, such as a human body, when placed in proximity to (e.g., on or close to) the object. The window and corresponding image displayed on a display screen of the portable electronic device change as the portable electronic device is moved over various portions of the body (e.g., abdomen, thorax, etc.). The image displayed by the portable electronic device may identify, for example, organs, arteries, veins, tissues, bone, and/or other bodily contents or parts. In various embodiments, the image may be presented in 3 dimensions such at it appears to the viewer as if the viewer is looking into the body, or as if the body parts have been projected up (e.g., exploded view) from the body.
The present disclosure provides numerous embodiments of systems, apparatus, computer readable media, and methods for providing imaging functionality using a portable electronic device, such as, for example, a smart phone or a tablet computer. In some embodiments, the portable electronic device is configured to generate and display an image of what appears to be an exploded view (e.g., 3-dimensional, upwardly projected image) of an object or its constituent parts.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a portable electronic device is provided that includes an imaging interface and one or more imaging elements. For example, the portable electronic device may be a cellular phone, personal digital assistant, smart phone, tablet device, digital camera, laptop computer, or the like. An image may be generated and/or rendered utilizing the portable electronic device. For example, the portable electronic device may be utilized to simulate as “window” into an imaging target, such as a human body or portion of the body. The simulated “window” may provide a view of the inside of a human body or portion of the body, including organs, arteries, veins, tissues, bone, and/or other bodily contents or parts. For example, an image (e.g., ultrasound or sonographic image) may be generated that illustrates and/or simulates internal features of the imaging target for a user. In some embodiments, a real-time continuous or substantially real-time continuous image may be generated and/or rendered such that movement of the portable electronic device results in a substantially real-time updated image of the area that corresponds to the new position of the portable electronic device. In some embodiments, internal movement of the target object (e.g., such as expansion and/or contraction of organs) may be rendered in real-time by the portable electronic device.
In some embodiments, the portable electronic devices and methods described herein may include, be coupled to (e.g., via a suitable communications connection or port such as a USB link), or otherwise utilize one or more radiation sources, sensors, and/or transducers (e.g., array(s) of ultrasound transducers), front-end processing circuitry and associated processing techniques, and/or image reconstruction devices and/or methods, in order to generate and/or render images to a user according to the non-limiting embodiments described in detail throughout the present disclosure.
In some embodiments of the present disclosure, one or more of the devices described in FIGS. 1A-8E herein may include or be coupled to one or more ultrasound imaging elements (e.g., one or more arrays of ultrasound sources, sensors, and/or transducers). One or more computers or processors within the portable electronic device may perform image analysis and/or image rendering based at least in part on radiation signals received by an imaging device.
 FIG. 1A illustrates a portable electronic device 100 including an imaging interface 102 for generating and/or rendering an internal image of a human body or a portion of a human body 106 according to some embodiments. FIG. 1B illustrates a three-dimensional internal image 110 of a portion of a human body that is generated and/or rendered by a portable electronic device 100 according to some embodiments. As shown in. FIG. 1A, the portable electronic device 100 may be positioned in an area near (e.g., in contact with the surface of or within about one meter from the surface of) a portion of a human body that is to be imaged and/or analyzed. The portable electronic device 100 may include imaging elements 104 that are configured to transmit and/or receive radiation signals. The imaging elements 104 along with other components and functions of the portable electronic device 100 according to some embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 2A-2B. An internal image 110 as shown in FIG. 1B may be generated by the portable electronic device 100. The internal image 110 may be a three-dimensional internal image of a portion of the human body that appears to a viewer 117 to project upward from a surface of the portable electronic device 100, giving the viewer the perception of a viewing window into the underlying body. Through generation of the internal image, the portable electronic device 100 may provide a window into the internal areas of the human body that are below the surface. As will be described in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 6A-6C, the generated images may be real-time continuous images such that the images are dynamically updated based on movement of the portable electronic device 100 and/or the image target (e.g., internal organs of the human body).
 FIG. 2A illustrates a front view of portable electronic device 100 including an imaging interface 102 according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The imaging interface 102 of the portable electronic device 100 may include a display that is configured to output a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) image of an imaging target. In some embodiments, the imaging interface 102 is interactive and is capable of receiving user input, for example through a touch-screen. An image that is displayed via the imaging interface 102 may be adjusted based on the received inputs, for example, to adjust zoom level, centering position, level of detail, depth of an underlying object to be imaged, resolution, brightness, color and/or the like of the image. For example, in some embodiments, imaging interface 102 may be configured to allow a user to selectively traverse various layers and imaging depths of the underlying object using, for example, the touch screen.
Portable electronic device 100 may render a three-dimensional image of the imaging target using any suitable method or combination of methods (e.g., anaglyph, polarization, eclipse, interference filtering, and/or austosteroscopy). For example, in some embodiments, the imaging interface 102 includes a circular polarizer and/or a linear polarizer such that a viewer having polarizing filtering spectacles can view a three-dimensional image. In some embodiments, the imaging interface 102 is configured to display alternating left and right images such that a viewer having spectacles with shutters that alternate in conjunction with the displayed image. In some embodiments, the imaging interface 102 may utilize an autostereoscopy method such that 3-D spectacles are not necessary for use by a viewer to view the three-dimensional image.
In some embodiments, portable electronic device 100 may display information (e.g., text and/or graphics) in addition to (e.g., graphically overlaid on top of or adjacent to) an image of a targeted object, such as, for example, text and/or graphics identifying the structure(s) identified in the image (e.g., organs, arteries, veins, tissues, bone, and/or other bodily contents or parts). In some embodiments, portable electronic device 100 may include one or more processors for identifying structure(s) identified in the image based at least in part on stored data (e.g., data stored in random access memory or other storage device of portable electronic device 100). For example, data stored within device 100 may identify characteristic(s) of structure(s) (e.g., one or more shapes, colors, textures, cellular characteristics, tissue characteristics, and/or other distinctive and/or surrounding features or structures) that may be present within different areas of the human body for use by personal electronic device 100 to identify and/or predict the type(s) of structures depicted in an image rendered by device 100. In some embodiments, data stored within device 100 may identify characteristics of particular disease(s) such as cancer or other abnormalities for use by personal electronic device 100 to identify and/or predict the type(s) of structures depicted in an image rendered by device 100. In some embodiments, the image, text, graphics, and/or other information displayed on the user interface 104 may be adjusted through user interaction with one or more inputs (e.g., touch screen, buttons, touch-sensitive areas, or the like) of the portable electronic device 100.
 FIG. 2B illustrates a back view of portable electronic device 100 including imaging elements 104 according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The imaging elements 104 may be configured as sources (emitters) and/or sensors of ultrasound radiation and/or other radiation. In some embodiments, the imaging elements 104 may be of substantially the same size and/or may be arranged in an array as shown in FIG. 2B. In some embodiments, the imaging elements 104 may be of different sizes and/or arranged in an irregular or scattered configuration.

In some embodiments, devices 100A and/or 100B may include one or more sensors for determining the relative positions of these devices to aid in the generation of image(s). While shown as a portable electronic device 100B (e.g., smart phone), in some embodiments device 100B may be a dedicated sensing and/or emitting device such as an array of ultrasound elements and associated circuitry. Signals (e.g., waves or beams 308) emitted from the portable electronic device 100B are sensed by the portable electronic device 100A and are utilized to render a 2-D or 3-D image 312 (e.g., real-time or substantially real-time image) of the target 306. In some embodiments, a generated 3-D image may be in the form of a pop-out image or a depth image. In some embodiments, the portable electronic device 100A may be configured to transmit signals (e.g., waves or beams) 308 though the target 306 to be received by the portable electronic device 100B. In some embodiments, the portable electronic device 100B may simultaneously or substantially simultaneously render an image (e.g., back view or alternate view or level of detail of an image rendered by device 100A) based at least in part on processing sensed signals. In some embodiments, the portable electronic devices 100A and/or 100B may communicate the results of the sensed signals to the other in order to generate or improve a rendered image.

The computer readable medium or media can be transportable, such that the program or programs stored thereon can be loaded onto one or more different computers or other processors to implement various ones of the aspects described above. In some embodiments, computer readable media may be non-transitory media.
The terms “program” or “software” are used herein in a generic sense to refer to any type of computer code or set of computer-executable instructions that can be employed to program a computer or other processor to implement various aspects as described above. Additionally, it should be appreciated that according to one aspect, one or more computer programs that when executed perform methods of the present application need not reside on a single computer or processor, but may be distributed in a modular fashion among a number of different computers or processors to implement various aspects of the present application.
Computer-executable instructions may be in many forms, such as program, modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.
Also, data structures may be stored in computer-readable media in any suitable form. For simplicity of illustration, data structures may be shown to have fields that are related through location in the data structure. Such relationships may likewise be achieved by assigning storage for the fields with locations in a computer-readable medium that convey relationship between the fields. However, any suitable mechanism may be used to establish a relationship between information in fields of a data structure, including through the use of pointers, tags or other mechanisms that establish relationship between data elements.
When implemented in software, the software code can be executed on any suitable processor or collection of processors, whether provided in a single computer or distributed among multiple computers.
Further, it should be appreciated that a computer may be embodied in any of a number of forms, such as a rack-mounted computer, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or a tablet computer, as non-limiting examples. Additionally, a computer may be embedded in a device not generally regarded as a computer but with suitable processing capabilities, including a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a smart phone or any other suitable portable or fixed electronic device.
Also, a computer may have one or more input and output devices. These devices can be used, among other things, to present a user interface. Examples of output devices that can be used to provide a user interface include printers or display screens for visual presentation of output and speakers or other sound generating devices for audible presentation of output. Examples of input devices that can be used for a user interface include keyboards, and pointing devices, such as mice, touch pads, and digitizing tablets. As another example, a computer may receive input information through speech recognition or in other audible formats.
Such computers may be interconnected by one or more networks in any suitable form, including a local area network or a wide area network, such as an enterprise network, and intelligent network (IN) or the Internet. Such networks may be based on any suitable technology and may operate according to any suitable protocol and may include wireless networks, wired networks or fiber optic networks.
Also, as described, some aspects may be embodied as one or more methods. The acts performed as part of the method may be ordered in any suitable way. Accordingly, embodiments may be constructed in which acts are performed. In an order different than illustrated, which may include performing some acts simultaneously, even though shown as sequential acts in illustrative embodiments.
All definitions, as defined and used herein, should be understood to control over dictionary definitions and/or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.
The indefinite articles “a” and “an,” as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean “at least one.”
The phrase “and/or,” as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean “either or both” of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with “and/or” should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., “one or more” of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B”, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.
As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase “at least one,” in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including,” “comprising,” or “having,” “containing,” “involving,” and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.

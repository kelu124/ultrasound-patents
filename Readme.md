# Use

## Parsing the different patents

Using:

 python us_patents.py

In yellow, the scraped patents, in white, the connected patents, but not scrapped yet. _It's interesting to note that the central patent is common to the three scrapped patents, but was not identified as being relevant for the moment._

## Uses

Plenty of things.. plus a .cache folder that .... caches the patents and images.
